Clonal Evolution of Autoreactive Germinal Centers.,"Germinal centers (GCs) are the primary sites of clonal B cell expansion and affinity maturation, directing the production of high-affinity antibodies. This response is a central driver of pathogenesis in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the natural history of autoreactive GCs remains unclear. Here, we present a novel mouse model where the presence of a single autoreactive B cell clone drives the TLR7-dependent activation, expansion, and differentiation of other autoreactive B cells in spontaneous GCs. Once tolerance was broken for one self-antigen, autoreactive GCs generated B cells targeting other self-antigens. GCs became independent of the initial clone and evolved toward dominance of individual clonal lineages, indicating affinity maturation. This process produced serum autoantibodies to a breadth of self-antigens, leading to antibody deposition in the kidneys. Our data provide insight into the maturation of the self-reactive B cell response, contextualizing the epitope spreading observed in autoimmune disease.",1
High-Definition Medicine.,"The foundation for a new era of data-driven medicine has been set by recent technological advances that enable the assessment and management of human health at an unprecedented level of resolution-what we refer to as high-definition medicine. Our ability to assess human health in high definition is enabled, in part, by advances in DNA sequencing, physiological and environmental monitoring, advanced imaging, and behavioral tracking. Our ability to understand and act upon these observations at equally high precision is driven by advances in genome editing, cellular reprogramming, tissue engineering, and information technologies, especially artificial intelligence. In this review, we will examine the core disciplines that enable high-definition medicine and project how these technologies will alter the future of medicine.",1
Cancer Evolution Constrained by the Immune Microenvironment.,"Tumor development is a Darwinian evolutionary process, involving the interplay between cancer subclones and the local immune microenvironment. These complex interactions are highlighted in this issue of Cell by the results from Jimenez-Sanchez et al. of a deep analysis of one patient with advanced serous carcinoma of the ovary.",1
Reprogramming Enhancers to Drive Metastasis.,"Acquired molecular changes can promote the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant tissues. In this issue of Cell, Roe et al. show that metastatic progression of pancreatic cancer involves large-scale enhancer reprogramming by Foxa1, which activates transcriptional program specifying early endodermal stem cells.",1
The Tropism of Pleiotrophin: Orchestrating Glioma Brain Invasion.,"The lateral ventricle (LV) is a preferential location for brain tumor spread; however, the instructive cues responsible for this unique tropism were previously unknown. In this issue, Qin et al. elucidate the underlying mechanism, demonstrating that LV-neural progenitors secrete a pleiotrophin (PTN)-containing complex, which attracts glioma cells through ROCK/Rho activation.",1
SnapShot: Cellular Senescence in Pathophysiology.,"Cellular senescence is a fundamental cell fate, important both in physiological and pathophysiological processes. This SnapShot focuses on the role of cellular senescence in health, disease, and aging.",1
In Situ Capture of Chromatin Interactions by Biotinylated dCas9.,"Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are commonly recognized by correlative chromatin features, yet the molecular composition of the vast majority of CREs in chromatin remains unknown. Here, we describe a CRISPR affinity purification in situ of regulatory elements (CAPTURE) approach to unbiasedly identify locus-specific chromatin-regulating protein complexes and long-range DNA interactions. Using an in vivo biotinylated nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein and sequence-specific guide RNAs, we show high-resolution and selective isolation of chromatin interactions at a single-copy genomic locus. Purification of human telomeres using CAPTURE identifies known and new telomeric factors. In situ capture of individual constituents of the enhancer cluster controlling human beta-globin genes establishes evidence for composition-based hierarchical organization. Furthermore, unbiased analysis of chromatin interactions at disease-associated cis-elements and developmentally regulated super-enhancers reveals spatial features that causally control gene transcription. Thus, comprehensive and unbiased analysis of locus-specific regulatory composition provides mechanistic insight into genome structure and function in development and disease.",1
Molecular and Circuit-Dynamical Identification of Top-Down Neural Mechanisms for Restraint of Reward Seeking.,"Reward-seeking behavior is fundamental to survival, but suppression of this behavior can be essential as well, even for rewards of high value. In humans and rodents, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in suppressing reward seeking; however, despite vital significance in health and disease, the neural circuitry through which mPFC regulates reward seeking remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that a specific subset of superficial mPFC projections to a subfield of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons naturally encodes the decision to initiate or suppress reward seeking when faced with risk of punishment. A highly resolved subpopulation of these top-down projecting neurons, identified by 2-photon Ca(2+) imaging and activity-dependent labeling to recruit the relevant neurons, was found capable of suppressing reward seeking. This natural activity-resolved mPFC-to-NAc projection displayed unique molecular-genetic and microcircuit-level features concordant with a conserved role in the regulation of reward-seeking behavior, providing cellular and anatomical identifiers of behavioral and possible therapeutic significance.",1
Activation and Desensitization Mechanism of AMPA Receptor-TARP Complex by Cryo-EM.,"AMPA receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain and transduce the binding of presynaptically released glutamate to the opening of a transmembrane cation channel. Within the postsynaptic density, however, AMPA receptors coassemble with transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), yielding a receptor complex with altered gating kinetics, pharmacology, and pore properties. Here, we elucidate structures of the GluA2-TARP gamma2 complex in the presence of the partial agonist kainate or the full agonist quisqualate together with a positive allosteric modulator or with quisqualate alone. We show how TARPs sculpt the ligand-binding domain gating ring, enhancing kainate potency and diminishing the ensemble of desensitized states. TARPs encircle the receptor ion channel, stabilizing M2 helices and pore loops, illustrating how TARPs alter receptor pore properties. Structural and computational analysis suggests the full agonist and modulator complex harbors an ion-permeable channel gate, providing the first view of an activated AMPA receptor.",1
Dynamic Reorganization of Neuronal Activity Patterns in Parietal Cortex.,"Neuronal representations change as associations are learned between sensory stimuli and behavioral actions. However, it is poorly understood whether representations for learned associations stabilize in cortical association areas or continue to change following learning. We tracked the activity of posterior parietal cortex neurons for a month as mice stably performed a virtual-navigation task. The relationship between cells' activity and task features was mostly stable on single days but underwent major reorganization over weeks. The neurons informative about task features (trial type and maze locations) changed across days. Despite changes in individual cells, the population activity had statistically similar properties each day and stable information for over a week. As mice learned additional associations, new activity patterns emerged in the neurons used for existing representations without greatly affecting the rate of change of these representations. We propose that dynamic neuronal activity patterns could balance plasticity for learning and stability for memory.",1
Restoration of TET2 Function Blocks Aberrant Self-Renewal and Leukemia Progression.,"Loss-of-function mutations in TET2 occur frequently in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with a DNA hypermethylation phenotype. To determine the role of TET2 deficiency in leukemia stem cell maintenance, we generated a reversible transgenic RNAi mouse to model restoration of endogenous Tet2 expression. Tet2 restoration reverses aberrant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with vitamin C, a co-factor of Fe2(+) and alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenases, mimics TET2 restoration by enhancing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine formation in Tet2-deficient mouse HSPCs and suppresses human leukemic colony formation and leukemia progression of primary human leukemia PDXs. Vitamin C also drives DNA hypomethylation and expression of a TET2-dependent gene signature in human leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, TET-mediated DNA oxidation induced by vitamin C treatment in leukemia cells enhances their sensitivity to PARP inhibition and could provide a safe and effective combination strategy to selectively target TET deficiency in cancer.

Neural Precursor-Derived Pleiotrophin Mediates Subventricular Zone Invasion by Glioma.,"The lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) is a frequent and consequential site of pediatric and adult glioma spread, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating this are poorly understood. We demonstrate that neural precursor cell (NPC):glioma cell communication underpins this propensity of glioma to colonize the SVZ through secretion of chemoattractant signals toward which glioma cells home. Biochemical, proteomic, and functional analyses of SVZ NPC-secreted factors revealed the neurite outgrowth-promoting factor pleiotrophin, along with required binding partners SPARC/SPARCL1 and HSP90B, as key mediators of this chemoattractant effect. Pleiotrophin expression is strongly enriched in the SVZ, and pleiotrophin knock down starkly reduced glioma invasion of the SVZ in the murine brain. Pleiotrophin, in complex with the binding partners, activated glioma Rho/ROCK signaling, and ROCK inhibition decreased invasion toward SVZ NPC-secreted factors. These findings demonstrate a pathogenic role for NPC:glioma interactions and potential therapeutic targets to limit glioma invasion. PAPERCLIP.",1
Excess Translation of Epigenetic Regulators Contributes to Fragile X Syndrome and Is Alleviated by Brd4 Inhibition.,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. FXS results from the loss of function of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which represses translation of target transcripts. Most of the well-characterized target transcripts of FMRP are synaptic proteins, yet targeting these proteins has not provided effective treatments. We examined a group of FMRP targets that encode transcriptional regulators, particularly chromatin-associated proteins. Loss of FMRP in mice results in widespread changes in chromatin regulation and aberrant gene expression. To determine if targeting epigenetic factors could reverse phenotypes associated with the disorder, we focused on Brd4, a BET protein and chromatin reader targeted by FMRP. Inhibition of Brd4 function alleviated many of the phenotypes associated with FXS. We conclude that loss of FMRP results in significant epigenetic misregulation and that targeting transcription via epigenetic regulators like Brd4 may provide new treatments for FXS.",1
Distinct Neural Circuits for the Formation and Retrieval of Episodic Memories.,"The formation and retrieval of a memory is thought to be accomplished by activation and reactivation, respectively, of the memory-holding cells (engram cells) by a common set of neural circuits, but this hypothesis has not been established. The medial temporal-lobe system is essential for the formation and retrieval of episodic memory for which individual hippocampal subfields and entorhinal cortex layers contribute by carrying out specific functions. One subfield whose function is poorly known is the subiculum. Here, we show that dorsal subiculum and the circuit, CA1 to dorsal subiculum to medial entorhinal cortex layer 5, play a crucial role selectively in the retrieval of episodic memories. Conversely, the direct CA1 to medial entorhinal cortex layer 5 circuit is essential specifically for memory formation. Our data suggest that the subiculum-containing detour loop is dedicated to meet the requirements associated with recall such as rapid memory updating and retrieval-driven instinctive fear responses.",1
Renal Sodium Gradient Orchestrates a Dynamic Antibacterial Defense Zone.,"Lower urinary tract infections are among the most common human bacterial infections, but extension to the kidneys is rare. This has been attributed to mechanical forces, such as urine flow, that prevent the ascent of bladder microbes. Here, we show that the regional hypersalinity, required for the kidney's urine-concentrating function, instructs epithelial cells to produce chemokines that localize monocyte-derived mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to the medulla. This hypersaline environment also increases the intrinsic bactericidal and neutrophil chemotactic activities of MNPs to generate a zone of defense. Because MNP positioning and function are dynamically regulated by the renal salt gradient, we find that patients with urinary concentrating defects are susceptible to kidney infection. Our work reveals a critical accessory role for the homeostatic function of a vital organ in optimizing tissue defense.",1
The Ground State and Evolution of Promoter Region Directionality.,"Eukaryotic promoter regions are frequently divergently transcribed in vivo, but it is unknown whether the resultant antisense RNAs are a mechanistic by-product of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription or biologically meaningful. Here, we use a functional evolutionary approach that involves nascent transcript mapping in S. cerevisiae strains containing foreign yeast DNA. Promoter regions in foreign environments lose the directionality they have in their native species. Strikingly, fortuitous promoter regions arising in foreign DNA produce equal transcription in both directions, indicating that divergent transcription is a mechanistic feature that does not imply a function for these transcripts. Fortuitous promoter regions arising during evolution promote bidirectional transcription and over time are purged through mutation or retained to enable new functionality. Similarly, human transcription is more bidirectional at newly evolved enhancers and promoter regions. Thus, promoter regions are intrinsically bidirectional and are shaped by evolution to bias transcription toward coding versus non-coding RNAs.",1
Distinct Cellular Mechanisms Underlie Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 Checkpoint Blockade.,"Immune-checkpoint blockade is able to achieve durable responses in a subset of patients; however, we lack a satisfying comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of anti-CTLA-4- and anti-PD-1-induced tumor rejection. To address these issues, we utilized mass cytometry to comprehensively profile the effects of checkpoint blockade on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models. These analyses reveal a spectrum of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations that are highly similar between tumor models and indicate that checkpoint blockade targets only specific subsets of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations. Anti-PD-1 predominantly induces the expansion of specific tumor-infiltrating exhausted-like CD8 T cell subsets. In contrast, anti-CTLA-4 induces the expansion of an ICOS(+) Th1-like CD4 effector population in addition to engaging specific subsets of exhausted-like CD8 T cells. Thus, our findings indicate that anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint-blockade-induced immune responses are driven by distinct cellular mechanisms.",1
Elimination of Toxic Microsatellite Repeat Expansion RNA by RNA-Targeting Cas9.,"Microsatellite repeat expansions in DNA produce pathogenic RNA species that cause dominantly inherited diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2 (DM1/2), Huntington's disease, and C9orf72-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS). Means to target these repetitive RNAs are required for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Here, we describe the development of a programmable CRISPR system capable of specifically visualizing and eliminating these toxic RNAs. We observe specific targeting and efficient elimination of microsatellite repeat expansion RNAs both when exogenously expressed and in patient cells. Importantly, RNA-targeting Cas9 (RCas9) reverses hallmark features of disease including elimination of RNA foci among all conditions studied (DM1, DM2, C9-ALS, polyglutamine diseases), reduction of polyglutamine protein products, relocalization of repeat-bound proteins to resemble healthy controls, and efficient reversal of DM1-associated splicing abnormalities in patient myotubes. Finally, we report a truncated RCas9 system compatible with adeno-associated viral packaging. This effort highlights the potential of RCas9 for human therapeutics.",1
Golgi-Resident Galphao Promotes Protrusive Membrane Dynamics.,"To form protrusions like neurites, cells must coordinate their induction and growth. The first requires cytoskeletal rearrangements at the plasma membrane (PM), the second requires directed material delivery from cell's insides. We find that the Galphao-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins localizes dually to PM and Golgi across phyla and cell types. The PM pool of Galphao induces, and the Golgi pool feeds, the growing protrusions by stimulated trafficking. Golgi-residing KDELR binds and activates monomeric Galphao, atypically for G protein-coupled receptors that normally act on heterotrimeric G proteins. Through multidimensional screenings identifying > 250 Galphao interactors, we pinpoint several basic cellular activities, including vesicular trafficking, as being regulated by Galphao. We further find small Golgi-residing GTPases Rab1 and Rab3 as direct effectors of Galphao. This KDELR --> Galphao --> Rab1/3 signaling axis is conserved from insects to mammals and controls material delivery from Golgi to PM in various cells and tissues.",1
SnapShot: Cellular Senescence Pathways.,"Cellular senescence is a fundamental cell fate, playing important physiological and pathophysiological roles. This SnapShot focuses on major signaling pathways and transcriptional control mechanisms that consolidate the senescence phenotype.",1
Dual ifgMosaic: A Versatile Method for Multispectral and Combinatorial Mosaic Gene-Function Analysis.,"Improved methods for manipulating and analyzing gene function have provided a better understanding of how genes work during organ development and disease. Inducible functional genetic mosaics can be extraordinarily useful in the study of biological systems; however, this experimental approach is still rarely used in vertebrates. This is mainly due to technical difficulties in the assembly of large DNA constructs carrying multiple genes and regulatory elements and their targeting to the genome. In addition, mosaic phenotypic analysis, unlike classical single gene-function analysis, requires clear labeling and detection of multiple cell clones in the same tissue. Here, we describe several methods for the rapid generation of transgenic or gene-targeted mice and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines containing all the necessary elements for inducible, fluorescent, and functional genetic mosaic (ifgMosaic) analysis. This technology enables the interrogation of multiple and combinatorial gene function with high temporal and cellular resolution.",1
Replication-Transcription Conflicts Generate R-Loops that Orchestrate Bacterial Stress Survival and Pathogenesis.,"Replication-transcription collisions shape genomes, influence evolution, and promote genetic diseases. Although unclear why, head-on transcription (lagging strand genes) is especially disruptive to replication and promotes genomic instability. Here, we find that head-on collisions promote R-loop formation in Bacillus subtilis. We show that pervasive R-loop formation at head-on collision regions completely blocks replication, elevates mutagenesis, and inhibits gene expression. Accordingly, the activity of the R-loop processing enzyme RNase HIII at collision regions is crucial for stress survival in B. subtilis, as many stress response genes are head-on to replication. Remarkably, without RNase HIII, the ability of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to infect and replicate in hosts is weakened significantly, most likely because many virulence genes are head-on to replication. We conclude that the detrimental effects of head-on collisions stem primarily from excessive R-loop formation and that the resolution of these structures is critical for bacterial stress survival and pathogenesis.",1
Transcription-Replication Conflict Orientation Modulates R-Loop Levels and Activates Distinct DNA Damage Responses.,"Conflicts between transcription and replication are a potent source of DNA damage. Co-transcriptional R-loops could aggravate such conflicts by creating an additional barrier to replication fork progression. Here, we use a defined episomal system to investigate how conflict orientation and R-loop formation influence genome stability in human cells. R-loops, but not normal transcription complexes, induce DNA breaks and orientation-specific DNA damage responses during conflicts with replication forks. Unexpectedly, the replisome acts as an orientation-dependent regulator of R-loop levels, reducing R-loops in the co-directional (CD) orientation but promoting their formation in the head-on (HO) orientation. Replication stress and deregulated origin firing increase the number of HO collisions leading to genome-destabilizing R-loops. Our findings connect DNA replication to R-loop homeostasis and suggest a mechanistic basis for genome instability resulting from deregulated DNA replication, observed in cancer and other disease states.",1
The Neuropeptide Corazonin Controls Social Behavior and Caste Identity in Ants.,"Social insects are emerging models to study how gene regulation affects behavior because their colonies comprise individuals with the same genomes but greatly different behavioral repertoires. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that activate distinct behaviors in different castes, we exploit a natural behavioral plasticity in Harpegnathos saltator, where adult workers can transition to a reproductive, queen-like state called gamergate. Analysis of brain transcriptomes during the transition reveals that corazonin, a neuropeptide homologous to the vertebrate gonadotropin-releasing hormone, is downregulated as workers become gamergates. Corazonin is also preferentially expressed in workers and/or foragers from other social insect species. Injection of corazonin in transitioning Harpegnathos individuals suppresses expression of vitellogenin in the brain and stimulates worker-like hunting behaviors, while inhibiting gamergate behaviors, such as dueling and egg deposition. We propose that corazonin is a central regulator of caste identity and behavior in social insects.",1
An Engineered orco Mutation Produces Aberrant Social Behavior and Defective Neural Development in Ants.,"Ants exhibit cooperative behaviors and advanced forms of sociality that depend on pheromone-mediated communication. Odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) express specific odorant receptors (ORs) encoded by a dramatically expanded gene family in ants. In most eusocial insects, only the queen can transmit genetic information, restricting genetic studies. In contrast, workers in Harpegnathos saltator ants can be converted into gamergates (pseudoqueens) that can found entire colonies. This feature facilitated CRISPR-Cas9 generation of germline mutations in orco, the gene that encodes the obligate co-receptor of all ORs. orco mutations should significantly impact olfaction. We demonstrate striking functions of Orco in odorant perception, reproductive physiology, and social behavior plasticity. Surprisingly, unlike in other insects, loss of OR functionality also dramatically impairs development of the antennal lobe to which ORNs project. Therefore, the development of genetics in Harpegnathos establishes this ant species as a model organism to study the complexity of eusociality.",1
orco Mutagenesis Causes Loss of Antennal Lobe Glomeruli and Impaired Social Behavior in Ants.,"Life inside ant colonies is orchestrated with diverse pheromones, but it is not clear how ants perceive these social signals. It has been proposed that pheromone perception in ants evolved via expansions in the numbers of odorant receptors (ORs) and antennal lobe glomeruli. Here, we generate the first mutant lines in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, by disrupting orco, a gene required for the function of all ORs. We find that orco mutants exhibit severe deficiencies in social behavior and fitness, suggesting they are unable to perceive pheromones. Surprisingly, unlike in Drosophila melanogaster, orco mutant ants also lack most of the approximately 500 antennal lobe glomeruli found in wild-type ants. These results illustrate that ORs are essential for ant social organization and raise the possibility that, similar to mammals, receptor function is required for the development and/or maintenance of the highly complex olfactory processing areas in the ant brain. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Cryo-EM Structure of the TOM Core Complex from Neurospora crassa.,"The TOM complex is the main entry gate for protein precursors from the cytosol into mitochondria. We have determined the structure of the TOM core complex by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex is a 148 kDa symmetrical dimer of ten membrane protein subunits that create a shallow funnel on the cytoplasmic membrane surface. In the core of the dimer, the beta-barrels of the Tom40 pore form two identical preprotein conduits. Each Tom40 pore is surrounded by the transmembrane segments of the alpha-helical subunits Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7. Tom22, the central preprotein receptor, connects the two Tom40 pores at the dimer interface. Our structure offers detailed insights into the molecular architecture of the mitochondrial preprotein import machinery.",1
Aged Stem Cells Reprogram Their Daily Rhythmic Functions to Adapt to Stress.,"Normal homeostatic functions of adult stem cells have rhythmic daily oscillations that are believed to become arrhythmic during aging. Unexpectedly, we find that aged mice remain behaviorally circadian and that their epidermal and muscle stem cells retain a robustly rhythmic core circadian machinery. However, the oscillating transcriptome is extensively reprogrammed in aged stem cells, switching from genes involved in homeostasis to those involved in tissue-specific stresses, such as DNA damage or inefficient autophagy. Importantly, deletion of circadian clock components did not reproduce the hallmarks of this reprogramming, underscoring that rewiring, rather than arrhythmia, is associated with physiological aging. While age-associated rewiring of the oscillatory diurnal transcriptome is not recapitulated by a high-fat diet in young adult mice, it is significantly prevented by long-term caloric restriction in aged mice. Thus, stem cells rewire their diurnal timed functions to adapt to metabolic cues and to tissue-specific age-related traits.",1
Circadian Reprogramming in the Liver Identifies Metabolic Pathways of Aging.,"The process of aging and circadian rhythms are intimately intertwined, but how peripheral clocks involved in metabolic homeostasis contribute to aging remains unknown. Importantly, caloric restriction (CR) extends lifespan in several organisms and rewires circadian metabolism. Using young versus old mice, fed ad libitum or under CR, we reveal reprogramming of the circadian transcriptome in the liver. These age-dependent changes occur in a highly tissue-specific manner, as demonstrated by comparing circadian gene expression in the liver versus epidermal and skeletal muscle stem cells. Moreover, de novo oscillating genes under CR show an enrichment in SIRT1 targets in the liver. This is accompanied by distinct circadian hepatic signatures in NAD(+)-related metabolites and cyclic global protein acetylation. Strikingly, this oscillation in acetylation is absent in old mice while CR robustly rescues global protein acetylation. Our findings indicate that the clock operates at the crossroad between protein acetylation, liver metabolism, and aging.",1
TREM2 Maintains Microglial Metabolic Fitness in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with hypomorphic variants of TREM2, a surface receptor required for microglial responses to neurodegeneration, including proliferation, survival, clustering, and phagocytosis. How TREM2 promotes such diverse responses is unknown. Here, we find that microglia in AD patients carrying TREM2 risk variants and TREM2-deficient mice with AD-like pathology have abundant autophagic vesicles, as do TREM2-deficient macrophages under growth-factor limitation or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Combined metabolomics and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) linked this anomalous autophagy to defective mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which affects ATP levels and biosynthetic pathways. Metabolic derailment and autophagy were offset in vitro through Dectin-1, a receptor that elicits TREM2-like intracellular signals, and cyclocreatine, a creatine analog that can supply ATP. Dietary cyclocreatine tempered autophagy, restored microglial clustering around plaques, and decreased plaque-adjacent neuronal dystrophy in TREM2-deficient mice with amyloid-beta pathology. Thus, TREM2 enables microglial responses during AD by sustaining cellular energetic and biosynthetic metabolism.",1
The PI3K Pathway in Human Disease.,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity is stimulated by diverse oncogenes and growth factor receptors, and elevated PI3K signaling is considered a hallmark of cancer. Many PI3K pathway-targeted therapies have been tested in oncology trials, resulting in regulatory approval of one isoform-selective inhibitor (idelalisib) for treatment of certain blood cancers and a variety of other agents at different stages of development. In parallel to PI3K research by cancer biologists, investigations in other fields have uncovered exciting and often unpredicted roles for PI3K catalytic and regulatory subunits in normal cell function and in disease. Many of these functions impinge upon oncology by influencing the efficacy and toxicity of PI3K-targeted therapies. Here we provide a perspective on the roles of class I PI3Ks in the regulation of cellular metabolism and in immune system functions, two topics closely intertwined with cancer biology. We also discuss recent progress developing PI3K-targeted therapies for treatment of cancer and other diseases.",1
Transcription-Replication Conflicts: Orientation Matters.,"Interference between DNA replication and transcription represents a major source of genomic instability. In this issue of Cell, Lang et al. and Hamperl et al. show that head-on collisions, but not codirectional collisions, impede fork progression in bacteria and in human cells by promoting the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids known as R-loops.",1

Keeping the Rhythm while Changing the Lyrics: Circadian Biology in Aging.,"Aging and circadian rhythms have been linked for decades, but their molecular interplay has remained obscure. Sato et al. and Solanas et al. now reveal that, while core clock components remain nearly unaltered, aging is associated with tissue-specific rewiring, which can be prevented by calorie restriction.",1

Cryo-EM Structure of a Pre-catalytic Human Spliceosome Primed for Activation.,"Little is known about the spliceosome's structure before its extensive remodeling into a catalytically active complex. Here, we report a 3D cryo-EM structure of a pre-catalytic human spliceosomal B complex. The U2 snRNP-containing head domain is connected to the B complex main body via three main bridges. U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP proteins, which are located in the main body, undergo significant rearrangements during tri-snRNP integration into the B complex. These include formation of a partially closed Prp8 conformation that creates, together with Dim1, a 5' splice site (ss) binding pocket, displacement of Sad1, and rearrangement of Brr2 such that it contacts its U4/U6 substrate and is poised for the subsequent spliceosome activation step. The molecular organization of several B-specific proteins suggests that they are involved in negatively regulating Brr2, positioning the U6/5'ss helix, and stabilizing the B complex structure. Our results indicate significant differences between the early activation phase of human and yeast spliceosomes.",1
Multi-invasions Are Recombination Byproducts that Induce Chromosomal Rearrangements.,"Inaccurate repair of broken chromosomes generates structural variants that can fuel evolution and inflict pathology. We describe a novel rearrangement mechanism in which translocation between intact chromosomes is induced by a lesion on a third chromosome. This multi-invasion-induced rearrangement (MIR) stems from a homologous recombination byproduct, where a broken DNA end simultaneously invades two intact donors. No homology is required between the donors, and the intervening sequence from the invading molecule is inserted at the translocation site. MIR is stimulated by increasing homology length and spatial proximity of the donors and depends on the overlapping activities of the structure-selective endonucleases Mus81-Mms4, Slx1-Slx4, and Yen1. Conversely, the 3'-flap nuclease Rad1-Rad10 and enzymes known to disrupt recombination intermediates (Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1, Srs2, and Mph1) inhibit MIR. Resolution of MIR intermediates propagates secondary chromosome breaks that frequently cause additional rearrangements. MIR features have implications for the formation of simple and complex rearrangements underlying human pathologies.",1
Enhancer Reprogramming Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Metastasis.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most lethal human malignancies, owing in part to its propensity for metastasis. Here, we used an organoid culture system to investigate how transcription and the enhancer landscape become altered during discrete stages of disease progression in a PDA mouse model. This approach revealed that the metastatic transition is accompanied by massive and recurrent alterations in enhancer activity. We implicate the pioneer factor FOXA1 as a driver of enhancer activation in this system, a mechanism that renders PDA cells more invasive and less anchorage-dependent for growth in vitro, as well as more metastatic in vivo. In this context, FOXA1-dependent enhancer reprogramming activates a transcriptional program of embryonic foregut endoderm. Collectively, our study implicates enhancer reprogramming, FOXA1 upregulation, and a retrograde developmental transition in PDA metastasis.",1
Non-neutralizing Antibodies Alter the Course of HIV-1 Infection In Vivo.,"Non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) to HIV-1 show little measurable activity in prevention or therapy in animal models yet were the only correlate of protection in the RV144 vaccine trial. To investigate the role of nnAbs on HIV-1 infection in vivo, we devised a replication-competent HIV-1 reporter virus that expresses a heterologous HA-tag on the surface of infected cells and virions. Anti-HA antibodies bind to, but do not neutralize, the reporter virus in vitro. However, anti-HA protects against infection in humanized mice and strongly selects for nnAb-resistant viruses in an entirely Fc-dependent manner. Similar results were also obtained with tier 2 HIV-1 viruses using a human anti-gp41 nnAb, 246D. While nnAbs are demonstrably less effective than broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 in vitro and in vivo, the data show that nnAbs can protect against and alter the course of HIV-1 infection in vivo.

The Molecular Architecture for RNA-Guided RNA Cleavage by Cas13a.,"Cas13a, a type VI-A CRISPR-Cas RNA-guided RNA ribonuclease, degrades invasive RNAs targeted by CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and has potential applications in RNA technology. To understand how Cas13a is activated to cleave RNA, we have determined the crystal structure of Leptotrichia buccalis (Lbu) Cas13a bound to crRNA and its target RNA, as well as the cryo-EM structure of the LbuCas13a-crRNA complex. The crRNA-target RNA duplex binds in a positively charged central channel of the nuclease (NUC) lobe, and Cas13a protein and crRNA undergo a significant conformational change upon target RNA binding. The guide-target RNA duplex formation triggers HEPN1 domain to move toward HEPN2 domain, activating the HEPN catalytic site of Cas13a protein, which subsequently cleaves both single-stranded target and collateral RNAs in a non-specific manner. These findings reveal how Cas13a of type VI CRISPR-Cas systems defend against RNA phages and set the stage for its development as a tool for RNA manipulation.",1

"Project DRIVE: A Compendium of Cancer Dependencies and Synthetic Lethal Relationships Uncovered by Large-Scale, Deep RNAi Screening.","Elucidation of the mutational landscape of human cancer has progressed rapidly and been accompanied by the development of therapeutics targeting mutant oncogenes. However, a comprehensive mapping of cancer dependencies has lagged behind and the discovery of therapeutic targets for counteracting tumor suppressor gene loss is needed. To identify vulnerabilities relevant to specific cancer subtypes, we conducted a large-scale RNAi screen in which viability effects of mRNA knockdown were assessed for 7,837 genes using an average of 20 shRNAs per gene in 398 cancer cell lines. We describe findings of this screen, outlining the classes of cancer dependency genes and their relationships to genetic, expression, and lineage features. In addition, we describe robust gene-interaction networks recapitulating both protein complexes and functional cooperation among complexes and pathways. This dataset along with a web portal is provided to the community to assist in the discovery and translation of new therapeutic approaches for cancer.",1
Defining a Cancer Dependency Map.,"Most human epithelial tumors harbor numerous alterations, making it difficult to predict which genes are required for tumor survival. To systematically identify cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic targets.",1
Fusobacterium nucleatum Promotes Chemoresistance to Colorectal Cancer by Modulating Autophagy.,"Gut microbiota are linked to chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Chemotherapy failure is the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigated the contribution of gut microbiota to chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer. We found that Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in patients with recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient clinicopathological characterisitcs. Furthermore, our bioinformatic and functional studies demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum targeted TLR4 and MYD88 innate immune signaling and specific microRNAs to activate the autophagy pathway and alter colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic response. Thus, F. nucleatum orchestrates a molecular network of the Toll-like receptor, microRNAs, and autophagy to clinically, biologically, and mechanistically control colorectal cancer chemoresistance. Measuring and targeting F. nucleatum and its associated pathway will yield valuable insight into clinical management and may ameliorate colorectal cancer patient outcomes.",1
Clustered Mutation Signatures Reveal that Error-Prone DNA Repair Targets Mutations to Active Genes.,"Many processes can cause the same nucleotide change in a genome, making the identification of the mechanisms causing mutations a difficult challenge. Here, we show that clustered mutations provide a more precise fingerprint of mutagenic processes. Of nine clustered mutation signatures identified from >1,000 tumor genomes, three relate to variable APOBEC activity and three are associated with tobacco smoking. An additional signature matches the spectrum of translesion DNA polymerase eta (POLH). In lymphoid cells, these mutations target promoters, consistent with AID-initiated somatic hypermutation. In solid tumors, however, they are associated with UV exposure and alcohol consumption and target the H3K36me3 chromatin of active genes in a mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent manner. These regions normally have a low mutation rate because error-free MMR also targets H3K36me3 chromatin. Carcinogens and error-prone repair therefore redistribute mutations to the more important regions of the genome, contributing a substantial mutation load in many tumors, including driver mutations.",1
A Genetic Variant Associated with Five Vascular Diseases Is a Distal Regulator of Endothelin-1 Gene Expression.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) implicate the PHACTR1 locus (6p24) in risk for five vascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, migraine headache, cervical artery dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and hypertension. Through genetic fine mapping, we prioritized rs9349379, a common SNP in the third intron of the PHACTR1 gene, as the putative causal variant. Epigenomic data from human tissue revealed an enhancer signature at rs9349379 exclusively in aorta, suggesting a regulatory function for this SNP in the vasculature. CRISPR-edited stem cell-derived endothelial cells demonstrate rs9349379 regulates expression of endothelin 1 (EDN1), a gene located 600 kb upstream of PHACTR1. The known physiologic effects of EDN1 on the vasculature may explain the pattern of risk for the five associated diseases. Overall, these data illustrate the integration of genetic, phenotypic, and epigenetic analysis to identify the biologic mechanism by which a common, non-coding variant can distally regulate a gene and contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple vascular diseases.",1
Methyltransferase SETD2-Mediated Methylation of STAT1 Is Critical for Interferon Antiviral Activity.,"Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) signaling is essential for antiviral response via induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Through a non-biased high-throughput RNAi screening of 711 known epigenetic modifiers in cellular models of IFNalpha-mediated inhibition of HBV replication, we identified methyltransferase SETD2 as a critical amplifier of IFNalpha-mediated antiviral immunity. Conditional knockout mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Setd2 exhibit enhanced HBV infection. Mechanistically, SETD2 directly mediates STAT1 methylation on lysine 525 via its methyltransferase activity, which reinforces IFN-activated STAT1 phosphorylation and antiviral cellular response. In addition, SETD2 selectively catalyzes the tri-methylation of H3K36 on promoters of some ISGs such as ISG15, leading to gene activation. Our study identifies STAT1 methylation on K525 catalyzed by the methyltransferase SETD2 as an essential signaling event for IFNalpha-dependent antiviral immunity and indicates potential of SETD2 in controlling viral infections.",1
Identification of Phosphorylation Codes for Arrestin Recruitment by G Protein-Coupled Receptors.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate diverse signaling in part through interaction with arrestins, whose binding promotes receptor internalization and signaling through G protein-independent pathways. High-affinity arrestin binding requires receptor phosphorylation, often at the receptor's C-terminal tail. Here, we report an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) crystal structure of the rhodopsin-arrestin complex, in which the phosphorylated C terminus of rhodopsin forms an extended intermolecular beta sheet with the N-terminal beta strands of arrestin. Phosphorylation was detected at rhodopsin C-terminal tail residues T336 and S338. These two phospho-residues, together with E341, form an extensive network of electrostatic interactions with three positively charged pockets in arrestin in a mode that resembles binding of the phosphorylated vasopressin-2 receptor tail to beta-arrestin-1. Based on these observations, we derived and validated a set of phosphorylation codes that serve as a common mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of arrestins by GPCRs.",1
Alzheimer's-Causing Mutations Shift Abeta Length by Destabilizing gamma-Secretase-Abetan Interactions.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked mutations in Presenilins (PSEN) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) lead to production of longer amyloidogenic Abeta peptides. The shift in Abeta length is fundamental to the disease; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that substrate shortening progressively destabilizes the consecutive enzyme-substrate (E-S) complexes that characterize the sequential gamma-secretase processing of APP. Remarkably, pathogenic PSEN or APP mutations further destabilize labile E-S complexes and thereby promote generation of longer Abeta peptides. Similarly, destabilization of wild-type E-S complexes by temperature, compounds, or detergent promotes release of amyloidogenic Abeta. In contrast, E-Abetan stabilizers increase gamma-secretase processivity. Our work presents a unifying model for how PSEN or APP mutations enhance amyloidogenic Abeta production, suggests that environmental factors may increase AD risk, and provides the theoretical basis for the development of gamma-secretase/substrate stabilizing compounds for the prevention of AD.",1
Identification of a Brainstem Circuit Controlling Feeding.,"Hunger, driven by negative energy balance, elicits the search for and consumption of food. While this response is in part mediated by neurons in the hypothalamus, the role of specific cell types in other brain regions is less well defined. Here, we show that neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, expressing vesicular transporters for GABA or glutamate (hereafter, DRN(Vgat) and DRN(VGLUT3) neurons), are reciprocally activated by changes in energy balance and that modulating their activity has opposite effects on feeding-DRN(Vgat) neurons increase, whereas DRN(VGLUT3) neurons suppress, food intake. Furthermore, modulation of these neurons in obese (ob/ob) mice suppresses food intake and body weight and normalizes locomotor activity. Finally, using molecular profiling, we identify druggable targets in these neurons and show that local infusion of agonists for specific receptors on these neurons has potent effects on feeding. These data establish the DRN as an important node controlling energy balance. PAPERCLIP.",1
How Ligands Illuminate GPCR Molecular Pharmacology.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are modulated by a variety of endogenous and synthetic ligands, represent the largest family of druggable targets in the human genome. Recent structural and molecular studies have both transformed and expanded classical concepts of receptor pharmacology and have begun to illuminate the distinct mechanisms by which structurally, chemically, and functionally diverse ligands modulate GPCR function. These molecular insights into ligand engagement and action have enabled new computational methods and accelerated the discovery of novel ligands and tool compounds, especially for understudied and orphan GPCRs. These advances promise to streamline the development of GPCR-targeted medications.",1
"Drugs, Bugs, and Cancer: Fusobacterium nucleatum Promotes Chemoresistance in Colorectal Cancer.","The tumor microenvironment has recently been shown to play decisive roles in chemotherapeutic response. In this issue of Cell, Yu et al. add to these findings by identifying the bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum as a previously unrecognized chemoresistance mediator in colorectal cancer, thereby establishing the microbiota as a potential therapeutic target.",1
Raphe Circuits on the Menu.,"The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is an important brain area for body-weight regulation. In this issue of Cell, Nectow et al. uncover cell-type-specific neural circuitry and pharmacology for appetite control within the DRN.",1
Genome Organization Drives Chromosome Fragility.,"In this study, we show that evolutionarily conserved chromosome loop anchors bound by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin are vulnerable to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2B (TOP2B). Polymorphisms in the genome that redistribute CTCF/cohesin occupancy rewire DNA cleavage sites to novel loop anchors. While transcription- and replication-coupled genomic rearrangements have been well documented, we demonstrate that DSBs formed at loop anchors are largely transcription-, replication-, and cell-type-independent. DSBs are continuously formed throughout interphase, are enriched on both sides of strong topological domain borders, and frequently occur at breakpoint clusters commonly translocated in cancer. Thus, loop anchors serve as fragile sites that generate DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Conformational Changes of CFTR upon Phosphorylation and ATP Binding.,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel evolved from an ATP-binding cassette transporter. CFTR channel gating is strictly coupled to phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis. Previously, we reported essentially identical structures of zebrafish and human CFTR in the dephosphorylated, ATP-free form. Here, we present the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the phosphorylated, ATP-bound conformation, determined by cryoelectron microscopy to 3.4 A resolution. Comparison of the two conformations shows major structural rearrangements leading to channel opening. The phosphorylated regulatory domain is disengaged from its inhibitory position; the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a ""head-to-tail"" dimer upon binding ATP; and the cytoplasmic pathway, found closed off in other ATP-binding cassette transporters, is cracked open, consistent with CFTR's unique channel function. Unexpectedly, the extracellular mouth of the ion pore remains closed, indicating that local movements of the transmembrane helices can control ion access to the pore even in the NBD-dimerized conformation.",1
Structure of the Nav1.4-beta1 Complex from Electric Eel.,"Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate and propagate action potentials. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of EeNav1.4, the Nav channel from electric eel, in complex with the beta1 subunit at 4.0 A resolution. The immunoglobulin domain of beta1 docks onto the extracellular L5I and L6IV loops of EeNav1.4 via extensive polar interactions, and the single transmembrane helix interacts with the third voltage-sensing domain (VSDIII). The VSDs exhibit ""up"" conformations, while the intracellular gate of the pore domain is kept open by a digitonin-like molecule. Structural comparison with closed NavPaS shows that the outward transfer of gating charges is coupled to the iris-like pore domain dilation through intricate force transmissions involving multiple channel segments. The IFM fast inactivation motif on the III-IV linker is plugged into the corner enclosed by the outer S4-S5 and inner S6 segments in repeats III and IV, suggesting a potential allosteric blocking mechanism for fast inactivation.",1
Mapping the Neural Substrates of Behavior.,"Assigning behavioral functions to neural structures has long been a central goal in neuroscience and is a necessary first step toward a circuit-level understanding of how the brain generates behavior. Here, we map the neural substrates of locomotion and social behaviors for Drosophila melanogaster using automated machine-vision and machine-learning techniques. From videos of 400,000 flies, we quantified the behavioral effects of activating 2,204 genetically targeted populations of neurons. We combined a novel quantification of anatomy with our behavioral analysis to create brain-behavior correlation maps, which are shared as browsable web pages and interactive software. Based on these maps, we generated hypotheses of regions of the brain causally related to sensory processing, locomotor control, courtship, aggression, and sleep. Our maps directly specify genetic tools to target these regions, which we used to identify a small population of neurons with a role in the control of walking.",1
3D Chromatin Structures of Mature Gametes and Structural Reprogramming during Mammalian Embryogenesis.,"High-order chromatin structure plays important roles in gene expression regulation. Knowledge of the dynamics of 3D chromatin structures during mammalian embryo development remains limited. We report the 3D chromatin architecture of mouse gametes and early embryos using an optimized Hi-C method with low-cell samples. We find that mature oocytes at the metaphase II stage do not have topologically associated domains (TADs). In sperm, extra-long-range interactions (>4 Mb) and interchromosomal interactions occur frequently. The high-order structures of both the paternal and maternal genomes in zygotes and two-cell embryos are obscure but are gradually re-established through development. The establishment of the TAD structure requires DNA replication but not zygotic genome activation. Furthermore, unmethylated CpGs are enriched in A compartment, and methylation levels are decreased to a greater extent in A compartment than in B compartment in embryos. In summary, the global reprogramming of chromatin architecture occurs during early mammalian development.",1
Exosome RNA Unshielding Couples Stromal Activation to Pattern Recognition Receptor Signaling in Cancer.,"Interactions between stromal fibroblasts and cancer cells generate signals for cancer progression, therapy resistance, and inflammatory responses. Although endogenous RNAs acting as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may represent one such signal, these RNAs must remain unrecognized under non-pathological conditions. We show that triggering of stromal NOTCH-MYC by breast cancer cells results in a POL3-driven increase in RN7SL1, an endogenous RNA normally shielded by RNA binding proteins SRP9/14. This increase in RN7SL1 alters its stoichiometry with SRP9/14 and generates unshielded RN7SL1 in stromal exosomes. After exosome transfer to immune cells, unshielded RN7SL1 drives an inflammatory response. Upon transfer to breast cancer cells, unshielded RN7SL1 activates the PRR RIG-I to enhance tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Corroborated by evidence from patient tumors and blood, these results demonstrate that regulation of RNA unshielding couples stromal activation with deployment of RNA DAMPs that promote aggressive features of cancer. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Ciliary Hedgehog Signaling Restricts Injury-Induced Adipogenesis.,"Injured skeletal muscle regenerates, but with age or in muscular dystrophies, muscle is replaced by fat. Upon injury, muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) proliferated and gave rise to adipocytes. These FAPs dynamically produced primary cilia, structures that transduce intercellular cues such as Hedgehog (Hh) signals. Genetically removing cilia from FAPs inhibited intramuscular adipogenesis, both after injury and in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Blocking FAP ciliation also enhanced myofiber regeneration after injury and reduced myofiber size decline in the muscular dystrophy model. Hh signaling through FAP cilia regulated the expression of TIMP3, a secreted metalloproteinase inhibitor, that inhibited MMP14 to block adipogenesis. A pharmacological mimetic of TIMP3 blocked the conversion of FAPs into adipocytes, pointing to a strategy to combat fatty degeneration of skeletal muscle. We conclude that ciliary Hh signaling by FAPs orchestrates the regenerative response to skeletal muscle injury.",1
Regulatory Expansion in Mammals of Multivalent hnRNP Assemblies that Globally Control Alternative Splicing.,"Alternative splicing (AS) patterns have diverged rapidly during vertebrate evolution, yet the functions of most species- and lineage-specific splicing events are not known. We observe that mammalian-specific AS events are enriched in transcript sequences encoding intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins, in particular those containing glycine/tyrosine repeats that mediate formation of higher-order protein assemblies implicated in gene regulation and human disease. These evolutionary changes impact nearly all members of the hnRNP A and D families of RNA binding proteins. Regulation of these events requires formation of unusual, long-range mammalian-specific RNA duplexes. Differential inclusion of the alternative exons controls the formation of tyrosine-dependent multivalent hnRNP assemblies that, in turn, function to globally regulate splicing. Together, our results demonstrate that AS control of IDR-mediated interactions between hnRNPs represents an important and recurring mechanism underlying splicing regulation. Furthermore, this mechanism has expanded the regulatory capacity of mammalian cells.",1
Splicing Activation by Rbfox Requires Self-Aggregation through Its Tyrosine-Rich Domain.,"Proteins of the Rbfox family act with a complex of proteins called the Large Assembly of Splicing Regulators (LASR). We find that Rbfox interacts with LASR via its C-terminal domain (CTD), and this domain is essential for its splicing activity. In addition to LASR recruitment, a low-complexity (LC) sequence within the CTD contains repeated tyrosines that mediate higher-order assembly of Rbfox/LASR and are required for splicing activation by Rbfox. This sequence spontaneously aggregates in solution to form fibrous structures and hydrogels, suggesting an assembly similar to the insoluble cellular inclusions formed by FUS and other proteins in neurologic disease. Unlike the pathological aggregates, we find that assembly of the Rbfox CTD plays an essential role in its normal splicing function. Rather than simple recruitment of individual regulators to a target exon, alternative splicing choices also depend on the higher-order assembly of these regulators within the nucleus.",1
Profiling Ssb-Nascent Chain Interactions Reveals Principles of Hsp70-Assisted Folding.,"The yeast Hsp70 chaperone Ssb interacts with ribosomes and nascent polypeptides to assist protein folding. To reveal its working principle, we determined the nascent chain-binding pattern of Ssb at near-residue resolution by in vivo selective ribosome profiling. Ssb associates broadly with cytosolic, nuclear, and hitherto unknown substrate classes of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) nascent proteins, supporting its general chaperone function. Ssb engages most substrates by multiple binding-release cycles to a degenerate sequence enriched in positively charged and aromatic amino acids. Timely association with this motif upon emergence at the ribosomal tunnel exit requires ribosome-associated complex (RAC) but not nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC). Ribosome footprint densities along orfs reveal faster translation at times of Ssb binding, mainly imposed by biases in mRNA secondary structure, codon usage, and Ssb action. Ssb thus employs substrate-tailored dynamic nascent chain associations to coordinate co-translational protein folding, facilitate accelerated translation, and support membrane targeting of organellar proteins.",1
Vaccine Mediated Protection Against Zika Virus-Induced Congenital Disease.,"The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with congenital malformations has prompted the rapid development of vaccines. Although efficacy with multiple viral vaccine platforms has been established in animals, no study has addressed protection during pregnancy. We tested in mice two vaccine platforms, a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding ZIKV prM and E genes and a live-attenuated ZIKV strain encoding an NS1 protein without glycosylation, for their ability to protect against transmission to the fetus. Vaccinated dams challenged with a heterologous ZIKV strain at embryo day 6 (E6) and evaluated at E13 showed markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues, which resulted in protection against placental damage and fetal demise. As modified mRNA and live-attenuated vaccine platforms can restrict in utero transmission of ZIKV in mice, their further development in humans to prevent congenital ZIKV syndrome is warranted.",1
Functional Profiling of a Plasmodium Genome Reveals an Abundance of Essential Genes.,"The genomes of malaria parasites contain many genes of unknown function. To assist drug development through the identification of essential genes and pathways, we have measured competitive growth rates in mice of 2,578 barcoded Plasmodium berghei knockout mutants, representing >50% of the genome, and created a phenotype database. At a single stage of its complex life cycle, P. berghei requires two-thirds of genes for optimal growth, the highest proportion reported from any organism and a probable consequence of functional optimization necessitated by genomic reductions during the evolution of parasitism. In contrast, extreme functional redundancy has evolved among expanded gene families operating at the parasite-host interface. The level of genetic redundancy in a single-celled organism may thus reflect the degree of environmental variation it experiences. In the case of Plasmodium parasites, this helps rationalize both the relative successes of drugs and the greater difficulty of making an effective vaccine.",1
"Evolution of the Human Nervous System Function, Structure, and Development.","The nervous system-in particular, the brain and its cognitive abilities-is among humans' most distinctive and impressive attributes. How the nervous system has changed in the human lineage and how it differs from that of closely related primates is not well understood. Here, we consider recent comparative analyses of extant species that are uncovering new evidence for evolutionary changes in the size and the number of neurons in the human nervous system, as well as the cellular and molecular reorganization of its neural circuits. We also discuss the developmental mechanisms and underlying genetic and molecular changes that generate these structural and functional differences. As relevant new information and tools materialize at an unprecedented pace, the field is now ripe for systematic and functionally relevant studies of the development and evolution of human nervous system specializations.",1
Unshielding Exosomal RNA Unleashes Tumor Growth And Metastasis.,"Reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment drive cancer progression and therapy resistance. In this issue, Nabet et al. demonstrate that dynamic feedback between tumor and stroma subverts normal inflammatory responses by triggering the release of exosomes containing unshielded RNAs that activate pattern recognition receptors, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis.",1
IL-4Ralpha Inhibitor for Atopic Disease.,"Dupilumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4Ralpha subunit of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors.

In March 2017, dupilumab was approved for use in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema). To view this Bench to Bedside, open or download the PDF.",1
Biology Gone Wild.,"To study how genes, cells, or organisms operate in natural environments, researchers often need to leave the bench and venture into the field.

Life-Long Genetic and Functional Access to Neural Circuits Using Self-Inactivating Rabies Virus.,"Neural networks are emerging as the fundamental computational unit of the brain and it is becoming progressively clearer that network dysfunction is at the core of a number of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, our ability to target specific networks for functional or genetic manipulations remains limited. Monosynaptically restricted rabies virus facilitates the anatomical investigation of neural circuits. However, the inherent cytotoxicity of the rabies largely prevents its implementation in long-term functional studies and the genetic manipulation of neural networks. To overcome this limitation, we developed a self-inactivating DeltaG-rabies virus (SiR) that transcriptionally disappears from the infected neurons while leaving permanent genetic access to the traced network. SiR provides a virtually unlimited temporal window for the study of network dynamics and for the genetic and functional manipulation of neural circuits in vivo without adverse effects on neuronal physiology and circuit function.",1
Distinct Ventral Pallidal Neural Populations Mediate Separate Symptoms of Depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients display a common but often variable set of symptoms making successful, sustained treatment difficult to achieve. Separate depressive symptoms may be encoded by differential changes in distinct circuits in the brain, yet how discrete circuits underlie behavioral subsets of depression and how they adapt in response to stress has not been addressed. We identify two discrete circuits of parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons in the ventral pallidum (VP) projecting to either the lateral habenula or ventral tegmental area contributing to depression. We find that these populations undergo different electrophysiological adaptations in response to social defeat stress, which are normalized by antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, manipulation of each population mediates either social withdrawal or behavioral despair, but not both. We propose that distinct components of the VP PV circuit can subserve related, yet separate depressive-like phenotypes in mice, which could ultimately provide a platform for symptom-specific treatments of depression.",1
Development of a Novel Lead that Targets M. tuberculosis Polyketide Synthase 13.,"Widespread resistance to first-line TB drugs is a major problem that will likely only be resolved through the development of new drugs with novel mechanisms of action. We have used structure-guided methods to develop a lead molecule that targets the thioesterase activity of polyketide synthase Pks13, an essential enzyme that forms mycolic acids, required for the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our lead, TAM16, is a benzofuran class inhibitor of Pks13 with highly potent in vitro bactericidal activity against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. In multiple mouse models of TB infection, TAM16 showed in vivo efficacy equal to the first-line TB drug isoniazid, both as a monotherapy and in combination therapy with rifampicin. TAM16 has excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, and the frequency of resistance for TAM16 is approximately 100-fold lower than INH, suggesting that it can be developed as a new antitubercular aimed at the acute infection. PAPERCLIP.",1
TERRA RNA Antagonizes ATRX and Protects Telomeres.,"Through an integration of genomic and proteomic approaches to advance understanding of long noncoding RNAs, we investigate the function of the telomeric transcript, TERRA. By identifying thousands of TERRA target sites in the mouse genome, we demonstrate that TERRA can bind both in cis to telomeres and in trans to genic targets. We then define a large network of interacting proteins, including epigenetic factors, telomeric proteins, and the RNA helicase, ATRX. TERRA and ATRX share hundreds of target genes and are functionally antagonistic at these loci: whereas TERRA activates, ATRX represses gene expression. At telomeres, TERRA competes with telomeric DNA for ATRX binding, suppresses ATRX localization, and ensures telomeric stability. Depleting TERRA increases telomerase activity and induces telomeric pathologies, including formation of telomere-induced DNA damage foci and loss or duplication of telomeric sequences. We conclude that TERRA functions as an epigenomic modulator in trans and as an essential regulator of telomeres in cis.",1
Approaching TERRA Firma: Genomic Functions of Telomeric Noncoding RNA.,"Functions of the telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from telomeres, have eluded researchers. In this issue of Cell, Graf el al. and Chu et al. uncover new regulatory roles for TERRA at the telomere and at distant genomic sites.",1
Telomere Length Determines TERRA and R-Loop Regulation through the Cell Cycle.,"Maintenance of a minimal telomere length is essential to prevent cellular senescence. When critically short telomeres arise in the absence of telomerase, they can be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) to prevent premature senescence onset. It is unclear why specifically the shortest telomeres are targeted for HDR. We demonstrate that the non-coding RNA TERRA accumulates as HDR-promoting RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) preferentially at very short telomeres. The increased level of TERRA and R-loops, exclusively at short telomeres, is due to a local defect in RNA degradation by the Rat1 and RNase H2 nucleases, respectively. Consequently, the coordination of TERRA degradation with telomere replication is altered at shortened telomeres. R-loop persistence at short telomeres contributes to activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and promotes recruitment of the Rad51 recombinase. Thus, the telomere length-dependent regulation of TERRA and TERRA R-loops is a critical determinant of the rate of replicative senescence.",1
LTR-Retrotransposon Control by tRNA-Derived Small RNAs.,"Transposon reactivation is an inherent danger in cells that lose epigenetic silencing during developmental reprogramming. In the mouse, long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, or endogenous retroviruses (ERV), account for most novel insertions and are expressed in the absence of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation in preimplantation stem cells. We found abundant 18 nt tRNA-derived small RNA (tRF) in these cells and ubiquitously expressed 22 nt tRFs that include the 3' terminal CCA of mature tRNAs and target the tRNA primer binding site (PBS) essential for ERV reverse transcription. We show that the two most active ERV families, IAP and MusD/ETn, are major targets and are strongly inhibited by tRFs in retrotransposition assays. 22 nt tRFs post-transcriptionally silence coding-competent ERVs, while 18 nt tRFs specifically interfere with reverse transcription and retrotransposon mobility. The PBS offers a unique target to specifically inhibit LTR-retrotransposons, and tRF-targeting is a potentially highly conserved mechanism of small RNA-mediated transposon control.",1
Splicing-Correcting Therapy for SMA.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by deficiency of SMN protein, which is crucial for spliceosome subunits biogenesis. Most SMA patients have SMN1 deletions, leaving SMN2 as sole SMN source; however, a C-->T substitution converts an exonic-splicing enhancer (ESE) to a silencer (ESS), causing frequent exon7 skipping in SMN2 pre-mRNA and yielding a truncated protein. Antisense treatment to SMN2 intron7-splicing silencer (ISS) improves SMN expression and motor function. To view this Bench to Bedside, open or download the PDF.",1
Structure Basis for Directional R-loop Formation and Substrate Handover Mechanisms in Type I CRISPR-Cas System.,"Type I CRISPR systems feature a sequential dsDNA target searching and degradation process, by crRNA-displaying Cascade and nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here we present two cryo-EM snapshots of the Thermobifida fusca type I-E Cascade: (1) unwinding 11 bp of dsDNA at the seed-sequence region to scout for sequence complementarity, and (2) further unwinding of the entire protospacer to form a full R-loop. These structures provide the much-needed temporal and spatial resolution to resolve key mechanistic steps leading to Cas3 recruitment. In the early steps, PAM recognition causes severe DNA bending, leading to spontaneous DNA unwinding to form a seed-bubble. The full R-loop formation triggers conformational changes in Cascade, licensing Cas3 to bind. The same process also generates a bulge in the non-target DNA strand, enabling its handover to Cas3 for cleavage. The combination of both negative and positive checkpoints ensures stringent yet efficient target degradation in type I CRISPR-Cas systems.",1
Massively Parallel Biophysical Analysis of CRISPR-Cas Complexes on Next Generation Sequencing Chips.,"CRISPR-Cas nucleoproteins target foreign DNA via base pairing with a crRNA. However, a quantitative description of protein binding and nuclease activation at off-target DNA sequences remains elusive. Here, we describe a chip-hybridized association-mapping platform (CHAMP) that repurposes next-generation sequencing chips to simultaneously measure the interactions between proteins and approximately 10(7) unique DNA sequences. Using CHAMP, we provide the first comprehensive survey of DNA recognition by a type I-E CRISPR-Cas (Cascade) complex and Cas3 nuclease. Analysis of mutated target sequences and human genomic DNA reveal that Cascade recognizes an extended protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Cascade recognizes DNA with a surprising 3-nt periodicity. The identity of the PAM and the PAM-proximal nucleotides control Cas3 recruitment by releasing the Cse1 subunit. These findings are used to develop a model for the biophysical constraints governing off-target DNA binding. CHAMP provides a framework for high-throughput, quantitative analysis of protein-DNA interactions on synthetic and genomic DNA. PAPERCLIP.",1
SnapShot: Electrochemical Communication in Biofilms.,"The role of electricity in biological systems was first appreciated through electrical stimulation experiments performed by Luigi Galvani in the 18(th) century. These pioneering experiments demonstrated that the behavior of living tissues is governed by the flow of electrochemical species-an insight that gave rise to the modern field of electrophysiology. Since then, electrophysiology has largely remained a bastion of neuroscience. However, exciting recent developments have demonstrated that even simple bacteria residing in communities use electrochemical communication to coordinate population-level behaviors. These recent works are defining the emerging field of bacterial biofilm electrophysiology. To view this SnapShot, open or download the PDF.",1
Type 2 Diabetes Variants Disrupt Function of SLC16A11 through Two Distinct Mechanisms.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects Latinos at twice the rate seen in populations of European descent. We recently identified a risk haplotype spanning SLC16A11 that explains approximately 20% of the increased T2D prevalence in Mexico. Here, through genetic fine-mapping, we define a set of tightly linked variants likely to contain the causal allele(s). We show that variants on the T2D-associated haplotype have two distinct effects: (1) decreasing SLC16A11 expression in liver and (2) disrupting a key interaction with basigin, thereby reducing cell-surface localization. Both independent mechanisms reduce SLC16A11 function and suggest SLC16A11 is the causal gene at this locus. To gain insight into how SLC16A11 disruption impacts T2D risk, we demonstrate that SLC16A11 is a proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter and that genetic perturbation of SLC16A11 induces changes in fatty acid and lipid metabolism that are associated with increased T2D risk. Our findings suggest that increasing SLC16A11 function could be therapeutically beneficial for T2D. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
RAS Proteins and Their Regulators in Human Disease.,"RAS proteins are binary switches, cycling between ON and OFF states during signal transduction. These switches are normally tightly controlled, but in RAS-related diseases, such as cancer, RASopathies, and many psychiatric disorders, mutations in the RAS genes or their regulators render RAS proteins persistently active. The structural basis of the switch and many of the pathways that RAS controls are well known, but the precise mechanisms by which RAS proteins function are less clear. All RAS biology occurs in membranes: a precise understanding of RAS' interaction with membranes is essential to understand RAS action and to intervene in RAS-driven diseases.",1
Complement-Related Regulates Autophagy in Neighboring Cells.,"Autophagy degrades cytoplasmic components and is important for development and human health. Although autophagy is known to be influenced by systemic intercellular signals, the proteins that control autophagy are largely thought to function within individual cells. Here, we report that Drosophila macroglobulin complement-related (Mcr), a complement ortholog, plays an essential role during developmental cell death and inflammation by influencing autophagy in neighboring cells. This function of Mcr involves the immune receptor Draper, suggesting a relationship between autophagy and the control of inflammation. Interestingly, Mcr function in epithelial cells is required for macrophage autophagy and migration to epithelial wounds, a Draper-dependent process. This study reveals, unexpectedly, that complement-related from one cell regulates autophagy in neighboring cells via an ancient immune signaling program.",1
Friction at the BAR Leads to Membrane Breakup.,"A long-standing question in cell biology is how endocytic vesicles and tubules detach from the plasma membrane in the absence of constriction by dynamin. In this issue of Cell, Simunovic et al. describe an elegant biophysical model in which friction between lipids and BAR-domain proteins drives the scission of elongating membrane tubules.",1
IFNgamma-Dependent Tissue-Immune Homeostasis Is Co-opted in the Tumor Microenvironment.,"Homeostatic programs balance immune protection and self-tolerance. Such mechanisms likely impact autoimmunity and tumor formation, respectively. How homeostasis is maintained and impacts tumor surveillance is unknown. Here, we find that different immune mononuclear phagocytes share a conserved steady-state program during differentiation and entry into healthy tissue. IFNgamma is necessary and sufficient to induce this program, revealing a key instructive role. Remarkably, homeostatic and IFNgamma-dependent programs enrich across primary human tumors, including melanoma, and stratify survival. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals enrichment of homeostatic modules in monocytes and DCs from human metastatic melanoma. Suppressor-of-cytokine-2 (SOCS2) protein, a conserved program transcript, is expressed by mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating primary melanoma and is induced by IFNgamma. SOCS2 limits adaptive anti-tumoral immunity and DC-based priming of T cells in vivo, indicating a critical regulatory role. These findings link immune homeostasis to key determinants of anti-tumoral immunity and escape, revealing co-opting of tissue-specific immune development in the tumor microenvironment.",1
A New Drug Target for Type 2 Diabetes.,"Genetic studies can identify novel therapeutic targets for common complex diseases. In this issue of Cell, Rusu et al. demonstrate that a cluster of genetic variants associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes affect the function of a monocarboxylate transporter involved in nutrient flux and hepatic lipid metabolism.",1
A Natural Allele of a Transcription Factor in Rice Confers Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance.,"Rice feeds half the world's population, and rice blast is often a destructive disease that results in significant crop loss. Non-race-specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race-specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability. Through a genome-wide association study, we report the identification of a natural allele of a C2H2-type transcription factor in rice that confers non-race-specific resistance to blast. A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10% of rice, suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding. This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance. Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice.",1
"How the Gut Feels, Smells, and Talks.","Gut-brain signaling plays a central role in a range of homeostatic processes, yet details of this cross-talk remain enigmatic. In this issue of Cell, Bellono and colleagues identify a variety of luminal stimuli acting on serotonin-secreting enteroendocrine cells and, for the first time, demonstrate a functional synaptic interaction with neurons.",1
A Sacrifice-for-Survival Mechanism Protects Root Stem Cell Niche from Chilling Stress.,"Temperature has a profound influence on plant and animal development, but its effects on stem cell behavior and activity remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the responses of the Arabidopsis root to chilling (low but above-freezing) temperature. Chilling stress at 4 degrees C leads to DNA damage predominantly in root stem cells and their early descendants. However, only newly generated/differentiating columella stem cell daughters (CSCDs) preferentially die in a programmed manner. Inhibition of the DNA damage response in these CSCDs prevents their death but makes the stem cell niche more vulnerable to chilling stress. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation indicate that CSCD death results in the re-establishment of the auxin maximum in the quiescent center (QC) and the maintenance of functional stem cell niche activity under chilling stress. This mechanism improves the root's ability to withstand the accompanying environmental stresses and to resume growth when optimal temperatures are restored.",1
De Novo Epigenetic Programs Inhibit PD-1 Blockade-Mediated T Cell Rejuvenation.,"Immune-checkpoint-blockade (ICB)-mediated rejuvenation of exhausted T cells has emerged as a promising approach for treating various cancers and chronic infections. However, T cells that become fully exhausted during prolonged antigen exposure remain refractory to ICB-mediated rejuvenation. We report that blocking de novo DNA methylation in activated CD8 T cells allows them to retain their effector functions despite chronic stimulation during a persistent viral infection. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of antigen-specific murine CD8 T cells at the effector and exhaustion stages of an immune response identified progressively acquired heritable de novo methylation programs that restrict T cell expansion and clonal diversity during PD-1 blockade treatment. Moreover, these exhaustion-associated DNA-methylation programs were acquired in tumor-infiltrating PD-1hi CD8 T cells, and approaches to reverse these programs improved T cell responses and tumor control during ICB. These data establish de novo DNA-methylation programming as a regulator of T cell exhaustion and barrier of ICB-mediated T cell rejuvenation.",1
Friction Mediates Scission of Tubular Membranes Scaffolded by BAR Proteins.,"Membrane scission is essential for intracellular trafficking. While BAR domain proteins such as endophilin have been reported in dynamin-independent scission of tubular membrane necks, the cutting mechanism has yet to be deciphered. Here, we combine a theoretical model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments revealing how protein scaffolds may cut tubular membranes. We demonstrate that the protein scaffold bound to the underlying tube creates a frictional barrier for lipid diffusion; tube elongation thus builds local membrane tension until the membrane undergoes scission through lysis. We call this mechanism friction-driven scission (FDS). In cells, motors pull tubes, particularly during endocytosis. Through reconstitution, we show that motors not only can pull out and extend protein-scaffolded tubes but also can cut them by FDS. FDS is generic, operating even in the absence of amphipathic helices in the BAR domain, and could in principle apply to any high-friction protein and membrane assembly.",1
Enterochromaffin Cells Are Gut Chemosensors that Couple to Sensory Neural Pathways.,"Dietary, microbial, and inflammatory factors modulate the gut-brain axis and influence physiological processes ranging from metabolism to cognition. The gut epithelium is a principal site for detecting such agents, but precisely how it communicates with neural elements is poorly understood. Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are proposed to fulfill this role by acting as chemosensors, but understanding how these rare and unique cell types transduce chemosensory information to the nervous system has been hampered by their paucity and inaccessibility to single-cell measurements. Here, we circumvent this limitation by exploiting cultured intestinal organoids together with single-cell measurements to elucidate intrinsic biophysical, pharmacological, and genetic properties of EC cells. We show that EC cells express specific chemosensory receptors, are electrically excitable, and modulate serotonin-sensitive primary afferent nerve fibers via synaptic connections, enabling them to detect and transduce environmental, metabolic, and homeostatic information from the gut directly to the nervous system.",1
SnapShot: Phosphoregulation of Mitosis.,"During mitosis, a cell divides its duplicated genome into two identical daughter cells. This process must occur without errors to prevent proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer). A key mechanism controlling mitosis is the precise timing of more than 32,000 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events by a network of kinases and counterbalancing phosphatases. The identity, magnitude, and temporal regulation of these events have emerged recently, largely from advances in mass spectrometry. Here, we show phosphoevents currently believed to be key regulators of mitosis. For an animated version of this SnapShot, please see http://www.cell.com/cell/enhanced/odonoghue2.",1
Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing.,"Systematic interrogation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is key to the development of immunotherapies and the prediction of their clinical responses in cancers. Here, we perform deep single-cell RNA sequencing on 5,063 single T cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, and adjacent normal tissues from six hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The transcriptional profiles of these individual cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, enable us to identify 11 T cell subsets based on their molecular and functional properties and delineate their developmental trajectory. Specific subsets such as exhausted CD8(+) T cells and Tregs are preferentially enriched and potentially clonally expanded in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we identified signature genes for each subset. One of the genes, layilin, is upregulated on activated CD8(+) T cells and Tregs and represses the CD8(+) T cell functions in vitro. This compendium of transcriptome data provides valuable insights and a rich resource for understanding the immune landscape in cancers.",1
Comprehensive and Integrative Genomic Characterization of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Liver cancer has the second highest worldwide cancer mortality rate and has limited therapeutic options. We analyzed 363 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases by whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy number analyses, and we analyzed 196 HCC cases by DNA methylation, RNA, miRNA, and proteomic expression also. DNA sequencing and mutation analysis identified significantly mutated genes, including LZTR1, EEF1A1, SF3B1, and SMARCA4. Significant alterations by mutation or downregulation by hypermethylation in genes likely to result in HCC metabolic reprogramming (ALB, APOB, and CPS1) were observed. Integrative molecular HCC subtyping incorporating unsupervised clustering of five data platforms identified three subtypes, one of which was associated with poorer prognosis in three HCC cohorts. Integrated analyses enabled development of a p53 target gene expression signature correlating with poor survival. Potential therapeutic targets for which inhibitors exist include WNT signaling, MDM4, MET, VEGFA, MCL1, IDH1, TERT, and immune checkpoint proteins CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1.",1
Structural Basis of Egg Coat-Sperm Recognition at Fertilization.,"Recognition between sperm and the egg surface marks the beginning of life in all sexually reproducing organisms. This fundamental biological event depends on the species-specific interaction between rapidly evolving counterpart molecules on the gametes. We report biochemical, crystallographic, and mutational studies of domain repeats 1-3 of invertebrate egg coat protein VERL and their interaction with cognate sperm protein lysin. VERL repeats fold like the functionally essential N-terminal repeat of mammalian sperm receptor ZP2, whose structure is also described here. Whereas sequence-divergent repeat 1 does not bind lysin, repeat 3 binds it non-species specifically via a high-affinity, largely hydrophobic interface. Due to its intermediate binding affinity, repeat 2 selectively interacts with lysin from the same species. Exposure of a highly positively charged surface of VERL-bound lysin suggests that complex formation both disrupts the organization of egg coat filaments and triggers their electrostatic repulsion, thereby opening a hole for sperm penetration and fusion.",1
Metabolic Adaptation Establishes Disease Tolerance to Sepsis.,"Sepsis is an often lethal syndrome resulting from maladaptive immune and metabolic responses to infection, compromising host homeostasis. Disease tolerance is a defense strategy against infection that preserves host homeostasis without exerting a direct negative impact on pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that induction of the iron-sequestering ferritin H chain (FTH) in response to polymicrobial infections is critical to establish disease tolerance to sepsis. The protective effect of FTH is exerted via a mechanism that counters iron-driven oxidative inhibition of the liver glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and in doing so, sustains endogenous glucose production via liver gluconeogenesis. This is required to prevent the development of hypoglycemia that otherwise compromises disease tolerance to sepsis. FTH overexpression or ferritin administration establish disease tolerance therapeutically. In conclusion, disease tolerance to sepsis relies on a crosstalk between adaptive responses controlling iron and glucose metabolism, required to maintain blood glucose within a physiologic range compatible with host survival.",1
Microbial Genetic Composition Tunes Host Longevity.,"Homeostasis of the gut microbiota critically influences host health and aging. Developing genetically engineered probiotics holds great promise as a new therapeutic paradigm to promote healthy aging. Here, through screening 3,983 Escherichia coli mutants, we discovered that 29 bacterial genes, when deleted, increase longevity in the host Caenorhabditis elegans. A dozen of these bacterial mutants also protect the host from age-related progression of tumor growth and amyloid-beta accumulation. Mechanistically, we discovered that five bacterial mutants promote longevity through increased secretion of the polysaccharide colanic acid (CA), which regulates mitochondrial dynamics and unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) in the host. Purified CA polymers are sufficient to promote longevity via ATFS-1, the host UPR(mt)-responsive transcription factor. Furthermore, the mitochondrial changes and longevity effects induced by CA are conserved across different species. Together, our results identified molecular targets for developing pro-longevity microbes and a bacterial metabolite acting on host mitochondria to promote longevity.",1
Antibacterial Nucleoside-Analog Inhibitor of Bacterial RNA Polymerase.,"Drug-resistant bacterial pathogens pose an urgent public-health crisis. Here, we report the discovery, from microbial-extract screening, of a nucleoside-analog inhibitor that inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and exhibits antibacterial activity against drug-resistant bacterial pathogens: pseudouridimycin (PUM). PUM is a natural product comprising a formamidinylated, N-hydroxylated Gly-Gln dipeptide conjugated to 6'-amino-pseudouridine. PUM potently and selectively inhibits bacterial RNAP in vitro, inhibits bacterial growth in culture, and clears infection in a mouse model of Streptococcus pyogenes peritonitis. PUM inhibits RNAP through a binding site on RNAP (the NTP addition site) and mechanism (competition with UTP for occupancy of the NTP addition site) that differ from those of the RNAP inhibitor and current antibacterial drug rifampin (Rif). PUM exhibits additive antibacterial activity when co-administered with Rif, exhibits no cross-resistance with Rif, and exhibits a spontaneous resistance rate an order-of-magnitude lower than that of Rif. PUM is a highly promising lead for antibacterial therapy.",1
SAF-A Regulates Interphase Chromosome Structure through Oligomerization with Chromatin-Associated RNAs.,"Higher eukaryotic chromosomes are organized into topologically constrained functional domains; however, the molecular mechanisms required to sustain these complex interphase chromatin structures are unknown. A stable matrix underpinning nuclear organization was hypothesized, but the idea was abandoned as more dynamic models of chromatin behavior became prevalent. Here, we report that scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), originally identified as a structural nuclear protein, interacts with chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) via its RGG domain to regulate human interphase chromatin structures in a transcription-dependent manner. Mechanistically, this is dependent on SAF-A's AAA(+) ATPase domain, which mediates cycles of protein oligomerization with caRNAs, in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis. SAF-A oligomerization decompacts large-scale chromatin structure while SAF-A loss or monomerization promotes aberrant chromosome folding and accumulation of genome damage. Our results show that SAF-A and caRNAs form a dynamic, transcriptionally responsive chromatin mesh that organizes large-scale chromosome structures and protects the genome from instability.",1
Independent and Stochastic Action of DNA Polymerases in the Replisome.,"It has been assumed that DNA synthesis by the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases in the replisome must be coordinated to avoid the formation of significant gaps in the nascent strands. Using real-time single-molecule analysis, we establish that leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases function independently within a single replisome. Although average rates of DNA synthesis on leading and lagging strands are similar, individual trajectories of both DNA polymerases display stochastically switchable rates of synthesis interspersed with distinct pauses. DNA unwinding by the replicative helicase may continue during such pauses, but a self-governing mechanism, where helicase speed is reduced by approximately 80%, permits recoupling of polymerase to helicase. These features imply a more dynamic, kinetically discontinuous replication process, wherein contacts within the replisome are continually broken and reformed. We conclude that the stochastic behavior of replisome components ensures complete DNA duplication without requiring coordination of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis. PAPERCLIP.",1
Dynamic RNA Modifications in Gene Expression Regulation.,"Over 100 types of chemical modifications have been identified in cellular RNAs. While the 5' cap modification and the poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNA play key roles in regulation, internal modifications are gaining attention for their roles in mRNA metabolism. The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), and identification of proteins that install, recognize, and remove this and other marks have revealed roles for mRNA modification in nearly every aspect of the mRNA life cycle, as well as in various cellular, developmental, and disease processes. Abundant noncoding RNAs such as tRNAs, rRNAs, and spliceosomal RNAs are also heavily modified and depend on the modifications for their biogenesis and function. Our understanding of the biological contributions of these different chemical modifications is beginning to take shape, but it's clear that in both coding and noncoding RNAs, dynamic modifications represent a new layer of control of genetic information.",1
An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.,"A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between genetic variation and disease. Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an ""omnigenic"" model.",1
Sex at Atomic Resolution.,"Interspecies fertilization is rare, partly due to species separation enforced at the molecular level. In this issue, Raj et al. now reveal the crystal structures of mollusk egg coat protein, VERL, complexed with cognate sperm protein lysin. Given that VERL is structurally similar to mammalian ZP2, the mechanism elucidating species-specific gamete recognition likely exists in mammals.",1
DAMed in (Trem) 2 Steps.,"The role of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases has been controversial. In this issue, Keren-Shaul et al. identify a unique population of disease-associated microglia (DAM) that develop in two steps and may help to restrict damage in Alzheimer and related diseases.",1
Just a Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Tolerance Go Up.,"Survival of deleterious infections depends significantly on how much stress the affected organism can tolerate. In this issue, Weis et al. find that mice can survive sepsis by maintaining normoglycemia through ferritin's capacity to inactivate Fe(2+) ions that otherwise induce free radicals impacting gluconeogenesis in the liver.",1
Microbiome and Longevity: Gut Microbes Send Signals to Host Mitochondria.,"The microbiome has emerged as a major determinant of the functioning of host organisms, affecting both health and disease. Here, Han et al. use the workhorse of aging research, C. elegans, to identify specific mechanisms by which gut bacteria influence mitochondrial dynamics and aging, a first step toward analogous manipulations to modulate human aging.",1
The Measure of a Man.,"Moving beyond simple fitness tracking, wearable devices may soon offer opportunities for monitoring health and bring vast amounts of new data to the study of human diseases.",1
Visuomotor Coupling Shapes the Functional Development of Mouse Visual Cortex.,"The emergence of sensory-guided behavior depends on sensorimotor coupling during development. How sensorimotor experience shapes neural processing is unclear. Here, we show that the coupling between motor output and visual feedback is necessary for the functional development of visual processing in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse. Using a virtual reality system, we reared mice in conditions of normal or random visuomotor coupling. We recorded the activity of identified excitatory and inhibitory L2/3 neurons in response to transient visuomotor mismatches in both groups of mice. Mismatch responses in excitatory neurons were strongly experience dependent and driven by a transient release from inhibition mediated by somatostatin-positive interneurons. These data are consistent with a model in which L2/3 of V1 computes a difference between an inhibitory visual input and an excitatory locomotion-related input, where the balance between these two inputs is finely tuned by visuomotor experience.",1
Cryo-EM Reveals How Human Cytoplasmic Dynein Is Auto-inhibited and Activated.,"Cytoplasmic dynein-1 binds dynactin and cargo adaptor proteins to form a transport machine capable of long-distance processive movement along microtubules. However, it is unclear why dynein-1 moves poorly on its own or how it is activated by dynactin. Here, we present a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the complete 1.4-megadalton human dynein-1 complex in an inhibited state known as the phi-particle. We reveal the 3D structure of the cargo binding dynein tail and show how self-dimerization of the motor domains locks them in a conformation with low microtubule affinity. Disrupting motor dimerization with structure-based mutagenesis drives dynein-1 into an open form with higher affinity for both microtubules and dynactin. We find the open form is also inhibited for movement and that dynactin relieves this by reorienting the motor domains to interact correctly with microtubules. Our model explains how dynactin binding to the dynein-1 tail directly stimulates its motor activity.",1
A Unique Microglia Type Associated with Restricting Development of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Abeta particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)(-/-) Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Structure of the Human Lipid Exporter ABCA1.,"ABCA1, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily A exporter, mediates the cellular efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol to the extracellular acceptor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) for generation of nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Mutations of human ABCA1 are associated with Tangier disease and familial HDL deficiency. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human ABCA1 with nominal resolutions of 4.1 A for the overall structure and 3.9 A for the massive extracellular domain. The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) display a nucleotide-free state, while the two transmembrane domains (TMDs) contact each other through a narrow interface in the intracellular leaflet of the membrane. In addition to TMDs and NBDs, two extracellular domains of ABCA1 enclose an elongated hydrophobic tunnel. Structural mapping of dozens of disease-related mutations allows potential interpretation of their diverse pathogenic mechanisms. Structural-based analysis suggests a plausible ""lateral access"" mechanism for ABCA1-mediated lipid export that may be distinct from the conventional alternating-access paradigm.",1
"Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling, Disease, and Emerging Therapeutic Modalities.","The WNT signal transduction cascade is a main regulator of development throughout the animal kingdom. Wnts are also key drivers of most types of tissue stem cells in adult mammals. Unsurprisingly, mutated Wnt pathway components are causative to multiple growth-related pathologies and to cancer. Here, we describe the core Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, how it controls stem cells, and contributes to disease. Finally, we discuss strategies for Wnt-based therapies.",1
Genetic Control of Floral Architecture: Insights into Improving Crop Yield.,"Selection of plants with traits that are beneficial for cultivation and consumption has been a common practice for thousands of years; however, combination of these traits can be detrimental too, for instance by leading to undesirable branching and yield loss in tomato. The findings from Soyk et al. in this issue of Cell help understand how to bypass such negative effects and improve crop productivity.",1
Curbing Tregs' (Lack of) Enthusiasm.,"In this issue, Overacre-Delgoffe et al. show that interferon gamma production by a subset of regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment triggers Treg instability locally and restores anti-tumor immunity.",1
Aldehydes Pose a Threat to BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.,"Humans with inherited heterozygous BRCA2 mutations have an increased risk of developing cancer; however, what triggers carcinogenesis in these individuals is unclear. Tan et al. find that environmental and metabolic aldehydes pose a threat to these individuals by promoting degradation of wild-type BRCA2 protein, thereby predisposing them to genomic instability and perhaps to cancer.",1
Noninvasive Neuromodulation Goes Deep.,"Modulating deep regions of the brain with noninvasive technology has challenged researchers for decades. In a new study, Grossman et al. leverage the emergence of a slowly oscillating ""beat"" from intersecting high-frequency electric fields to stimulate deep brain regions, opening a frontier in the biophysics and technology of brain stimulation.",1
How Do We Recognize a Face?,"How individual faces are encoded by neurons in high-level visual areas has been a subject of active debate. An influential model is that neurons encode specific faces. However, Chang and Tsao conclusively show that, instead, these neurons encode features along specific axes, which explains why they were previously found to respond to apparently different faces.",1
A Class of Environmental and Endogenous Toxins Induces BRCA2 Haploinsufficiency and Genome Instability.,"Mutations truncating a single copy of the tumor suppressor, BRCA2, cause cancer susceptibility. In cells bearing such heterozygous mutations, we find that a cellular metabolite and ubiquitous environmental toxin, formaldehyde, stalls and destabilizes DNA replication forks, engendering structural chromosomal aberrations. Formaldehyde selectively depletes BRCA2 via proteasomal degradation, a mechanism of toxicity that affects very few additional cellular proteins. Heterozygous BRCA2 truncations, by lowering pre-existing BRCA2 expression, sensitize to BRCA2 haploinsufficiency induced by transient exposure to natural concentrations of formaldehyde. Acetaldehyde, an alcohol catabolite detoxified by ALDH2, precipitates similar effects. Ribonuclease H1 ameliorates replication fork instability and chromosomal aberrations provoked by aldehyde-induced BRCA2 haploinsufficiency, suggesting that BRCA2 inactivation triggers spontaneous mutagenesis during DNA replication via aberrant RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). These findings suggest a model wherein carcinogenesis in BRCA2 mutation carriers can be incited by compounds found pervasively in the environment and generated endogenously in certain tissues with implications for public health.",1
Structural Basis for Mitotic Centrosome Assembly in Flies.,"In flies, Centrosomin (Cnn) forms a phosphorylation-dependent scaffold that recruits proteins to the mitotic centrosome, but how Cnn assembles into a scaffold is unclear. We show that scaffold assembly requires conserved leucine zipper (LZ) and Cnn-motif 2 (CM2) domains that co-assemble into a 2:2 complex in vitro. We solve the crystal structure of the LZ:CM2 complex, revealing that both proteins form helical dimers that assemble into an unusual tetramer. A slightly longer version of the LZ can form micron-scale structures with CM2, whose assembly is stimulated by Plk1 phosphorylation in vitro. Mutating individual residues that perturb LZ:CM2 tetramer assembly perturbs the formation of these micron-scale assemblies in vitro and Cnn-scaffold assembly in vivo. Thus, Cnn molecules have an intrinsic ability to form large, LZ:CM2-interaction-dependent assemblies that are critical for mitotic centrosome assembly. These studies provide the first atomic insight into a molecular interaction required for mitotic centrosome assembly.",1
The Centrosome Is a Selective Condensate that Nucleates Microtubules by Concentrating Tubulin.,"Centrosomes are non-membrane-bound compartments that nucleate microtubule arrays. They consist of nanometer-scale centrioles surrounded by a micron-scale, dynamic assembly of protein called the pericentriolar material (PCM). To study how PCM forms a spherical compartment that nucleates microtubules, we reconstituted PCM-dependent microtubule nucleation in vitro using recombinant C. elegans proteins. We found that macromolecular crowding drives assembly of the key PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 into spherical condensates that morphologically and dynamically resemble in vivo PCM. These SPD-5 condensates recruited the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9 (XMAP215 homolog) and the microtubule-stabilizing protein TPXL-1 (TPX2 homolog). Together, these three proteins concentrated tubulin approximately 4-fold over background, which was sufficient to reconstitute nucleation of microtubule asters in vitro. Our results suggest that in vivo PCM is a selective phase that organizes microtubule arrays through localized concentration of tubulin by microtubule effector proteins.",1
The Mammalian Ribo-interactome Reveals Ribosome Functional Diversity and Heterogeneity.,"During eukaryotic evolution, ribosomes have considerably increased in size, forming a surface-exposed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) shell of unknown function, which may create an interface for yet uncharacterized interacting proteins. To investigate such protein interactions, we establish a ribosome affinity purification method that unexpectedly identifies hundreds of ribosome-associated proteins (RAPs) from categories including metabolism and cell cycle, as well as RNA- and protein-modifying enzymes that functionally diversify mammalian ribosomes. By further characterizing RAPs, we discover the presence of ufmylation, a metazoan-specific post-translational modification (PTM), on ribosomes and define its direct substrates. Moreover, we show that the metabolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), interacts with sub-pools of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes, exerting a non-canonical function as an RNA-binding protein in the translation of ER-destined mRNAs. Therefore, RAPs interconnect one of life's most ancient molecular machines with diverse cellular processes, providing an additional layer of regulatory potential to protein expression.",1
Cryo-EM Structure of a KCNQ1/CaM Complex Reveals Insights into Congenital Long QT Syndrome.,"KCNQ1 is the pore-forming subunit of cardiac slow-delayed rectifier potassium (IKs) channels. Mutations in the kcnq1 gene are the leading cause of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a KCNQ1/calmodulin (CaM) complex. The conformation corresponds to an ""uncoupled,"" PIP2-free state of KCNQ1, with activated voltage sensors and a closed pore. Unique structural features within the S4-S5 linker permit uncoupling of the voltage sensor from the pore in the absence of PIP2. CaM contacts the KCNQ1 voltage sensor through a specific interface involving a residue on CaM that is mutated in a form of inherited LQTS. Using an electrophysiological assay, we find that this mutation on CaM shifts the KCNQ1 voltage-activation curve. This study describes one physiological form of KCNQ1, depolarized voltage sensors with a closed pore in the absence of PIP2, and reveals a regulatory interaction between CaM and KCNQ1 that may explain CaM-mediated LQTS.",1
Noninvasive Deep Brain Stimulation via Temporally Interfering Electric Fields.,"We report a noninvasive strategy for electrically stimulating neurons at depth. By delivering to the brain multiple electric fields at frequencies too high to recruit neural firing, but which differ by a frequency within the dynamic range of neural firing, we can electrically stimulate neurons throughout a region where interference between the multiple fields results in a prominent electric field envelope modulated at the difference frequency. We validated this temporal interference (TI) concept via modeling and physics experiments, and verified that neurons in the living mouse brain could follow the electric field envelope. We demonstrate the utility of TI stimulation by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus of living mice without recruiting neurons of the overlying cortex. Finally, we show that by altering the currents delivered to a set of immobile electrodes, we can steerably evoke different motor patterns in living mice.",1
The Code for Facial Identity in the Primate Brain.,"Primates recognize complex objects such as faces with remarkable speed and reliability. Here, we reveal the brain's code for facial identity. Experiments in macaques demonstrate an extraordinarily simple transformation between faces and responses of cells in face patches. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, we discovered that each face cell's firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble to encode the location of any face in the space. Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells. Our work suggests that other objects could be encoded by analogous metric coordinate systems. PAPERCLIP.",1
Senescence in Health and Disease.,"Many cellular stresses activate senescence, a persistent hyporeplicative state characterized in part by expression of the p16(INK4a) cell-cycle inhibitor. Senescent cell production occurs throughout life and plays beneficial roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including embryogenesis, wound healing, host immunity, and tumor suppression. Meanwhile, the steady accumulation of senescent cells with age also has adverse consequences. These non-proliferating cells occupy key cellular niches and elaborate pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to aging-related diseases and morbidity. This model suggests that the abundance of senescent cells in vivo predicts ""molecular,"" as opposed to chronologic, age and that senescent cell clearance may mitigate aging-associated pathology.",1
Interferon-gamma Drives Treg Fragility to Promote Anti-tumor Immunity.,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a barrier to anti-tumor immunity. Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is required to maintain intratumoral Treg stability and function but is dispensable for peripheral immune tolerance. Treg-restricted Nrp1 deletion results in profound tumor resistance due to Treg functional fragility. Thus, identifying the basis for Nrp1 dependency and the key drivers of Treg fragility could help to improve immunotherapy for human cancer. We show that a high percentage of intratumoral NRP1(+) Tregs correlates with poor prognosis in melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using a mouse model of melanoma where Nrp1-deficient (Nrp1(-/-)) and wild-type (Nrp1(+/+)) Tregs can be assessed in a competitive environment, we find that a high proportion of intratumoral Nrp1(-/-) Tregs produce interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), which drives the fragility of surrounding wild-type Tregs, boosts anti-tumor immunity, and facilitates tumor clearance. We also show that IFNgamma-induced Treg fragility is required for response to anti-PD1, suggesting that cancer therapies promoting Treg fragility may be efficacious.",1
Regulatory T Cells in Skin Facilitate Epithelial Stem Cell Differentiation.,"The maintenance of tissue homeostasis is critically dependent on the function of tissue-resident immune cells and the differentiation capacity of tissue-resident stem cells (SCs). How immune cells influence the function of SCs is largely unknown. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in skin preferentially localize to hair follicles (HFs), which house a major subset of skin SCs (HFSCs). Here, we mechanistically dissect the role of Tregs in HF and HFSC biology. Lineage-specific cell depletion revealed that Tregs promote HF regeneration by augmenting HFSC proliferation and differentiation. Transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of Tregs and HFSCs revealed that skin-resident Tregs preferentially express high levels of the Notch ligand family member, Jagged 1 (Jag1). Expression of Jag1 on Tregs facilitated HFSC function and efficient HF regeneration. Taken together, our work demonstrates that Tregs in skin play a major role in HF biology by promoting the function of HFSCs.",1
Ubiquitination-Deficient Mutations in Human Piwi Cause Male Infertility by Impairing Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis.,"Genetic studies have elucidated critical roles of Piwi proteins in germline development in animals, but whether Piwi is an actual disease gene in human infertility remains unknown. We report germline mutations in human Piwi (Hiwi) in patients with azoospermia that prevent its ubiquitination and degradation. By modeling such mutations in Piwi (Miwi) knockin mice, we demonstrate that the genetic defects are directly responsible for male infertility. Mechanistically, we show that MIWI binds the histone ubiquitin ligase RNF8 in a Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-independent manner, and MIWI stabilization sequesters RNF8 in the cytoplasm of late spermatids. The resulting aberrant sperm show histone retention, abnormal morphology, and severely compromised activity, which can be functionally rescued via blocking RNF8-MIWI interaction in spermatids with an RNF8-N peptide. Collectively, our findings identify Piwi as a factor in human infertility and reveal its role in regulating the histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis.",1
Bypassing Negative Epistasis on Yield in Tomato Imposed by a Domestication Gene.,"Selection for inflorescence architecture with improved flower production and yield is common to many domesticated crops. However, tomato inflorescences resemble wild ancestors, and breeders avoided excessive branching because of low fertility. We found branched variants carry mutations in two related transcription factors that were selected independently. One founder mutation enlarged the leaf-like organs on fruits and was selected as fruit size increased during domestication. The other mutation eliminated the flower abscission zone, providing ""jointless"" fruit stems that reduced fruit dropping and facilitated mechanical harvesting. Stacking both beneficial traits caused undesirable branching and sterility due to epistasis, which breeders overcame with suppressors. However, this suppression restricted the opportunity for productivity gains from weak branching. Exploiting natural and engineered alleles for multiple family members, we achieved a continuum of inflorescence complexity that allowed breeding of higher-yielding hybrids. Characterizing and neutralizing similar cases of negative epistasis could improve productivity in many agricultural organisms. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1

Modeling Rett Syndrome Using TALEN-Edited MECP2 Mutant Cynomolgus Monkeys.,"Gene-editing technologies have made it feasible to create nonhuman primate models for human genetic disorders. Here, we report detailed genotypes and phenotypes of TALEN-edited MECP2 mutant cynomolgus monkeys serving as a model for a neurodevelopmental disorder, Rett syndrome (RTT), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the human MECP2 gene. Male mutant monkeys were embryonic lethal, reiterating that RTT is a disease of females. Through a battery of behavioral analyses, including primate-unique eye-tracking tests, in combination with brain imaging via MRI, we found a series of physiological, behavioral, and structural abnormalities resembling clinical manifestations of RTT. Moreover, blood transcriptome profiling revealed that mutant monkeys resembled RTT patients in immune gene dysregulation. Taken together, the stark similarity in phenotype and/or endophenotype between monkeys and patients suggested that gene-edited RTT founder monkeys would be of value for disease mechanistic studies as well as development of potential therapeutic interventions for RTT.",1
Targeted Degradation of CTCF Decouples Local Insulation of Chromosome Domains from Genomic Compartmentalization.,"The molecular mechanisms underlying folding of mammalian chromosomes remain poorly understood. The transcription factor CTCF is a candidate regulator of chromosomal structure. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Furthermore, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading. Beyond defining the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, these results provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.",1
Widespread Influence of 3'-End Structures on Mammalian mRNA Processing and Stability.,"The physiological relevance of structures within mammalian mRNAs has been elusive, as these mRNAs are less folded in cells than in vitro and have predicted secondary structures no more stable than those of random sequences. Here, we investigate the possibility that mRNA structures facilitate the 3'-end processing of thousands of human mRNAs by juxtaposing poly(A) signals (PASs) and cleavage sites that are otherwise too far apart. We find that RNA structures are predicted to be more prevalent within these extended 3'-end regions than within PAS-upstream regions and indeed are substantially more folded within cells, as determined by intracellular probing. Analyses of thousands of ectopically expressed variants demonstrate that this folding both enhances processing and increases mRNA metabolic stability. Even folds with predicted stabilities resembling those of random sequences can enhance processing. Structure-controlled processing can also regulate neighboring gene expression. Thus, RNA structure has widespread roles in mammalian mRNA biogenesis and metabolism.",1
Immunization-Elicited Broadly Protective Antibody Reveals Ebolavirus Fusion Loop as a Site of Vulnerability.,"While neutralizing antibodies are highly effective against ebolavirus infections, current experimental ebolavirus vaccines primarily elicit species-specific antibody responses. Here, we describe an immunization-elicited macaque antibody (CA45) that clamps the internal fusion loop with the N terminus of the ebolavirus glycoproteins (GPs) and potently neutralizes Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Reston viruses. CA45, alone or in combination with an antibody that blocks receptor binding, provided full protection against all pathogenic ebolaviruses in mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets. Analysis of memory B cells from the immunized macaque suggests that elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for ebolaviruses is possible but difficult, potentially due to the rarity of bNAb clones and their precursors. Unexpectedly, germline-reverted CA45, while exhibiting negligible binding to full-length GP, bound a proteolytically remodeled GP with picomolar affinity, suggesting that engineered ebolavirus vaccines could trigger rare bNAb precursors more robustly. These findings have important implications for developing pan-ebolavirus vaccine and immunotherapeutic cocktails.",1
Antibodies from a Human Survivor Define Sites of Vulnerability for Broad Protection against Ebolaviruses.,"Experimental monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies have shown promise for treatment of lethal Ebola virus (EBOV) infections, but their species-specific recognition of the viral glycoprotein (GP) has limited their use against other divergent ebolaviruses associated with human disease. Here, we mined the human immune response to natural EBOV infection and identified mAbs with exceptionally potent pan-ebolavirus neutralizing activity and protective efficacy against three virulent ebolaviruses. These mAbs recognize an inter-protomer epitope in the GP fusion loop, a critical and conserved element of the viral membrane fusion machinery, and neutralize viral entry by targeting a proteolytically primed, fusion-competent GP intermediate (GPCL) generated in host cell endosomes. Only a few somatic hypermutations are required for broad antiviral activity, and germline-approximating variants display enhanced GPCL recognition, suggesting that such antibodies could be elicited more efficiently with suitably optimized GP immunogens. Our findings inform the development of both broadly effective immunotherapeutics and vaccines against filoviruses.",1
Regulated Intron Removal Integrates Motivational State and Experience.,"Myriad experiences produce transient memory, yet, contingent on the internal state of the organism and the saliency of the experience, only some memories persist over time. How experience and internal state influence the duration of memory at the molecular level remains unknown. A self-assembled aggregated state of Drosophila Orb2A protein is required specifically for long-lasting memory. We report that in the adult fly brain the mRNA encoding Orb2A protein exists in an unspliced non-protein-coding form. The convergence of experience and internal drive transiently increases the spliced protein-coding Orb2A mRNA. A screen identified pasilla, the fly ortholog of mammalian Nova-1/2, as a mediator of Orb2A mRNA processing. A single-nucleotide substitution in the intronic region that reduces Pasilla binding and intron removal selectively impairs long-term memory. We posit that pasilla-mediated processing of unspliced Orb2A mRNA integrates experience and internal state to control Orb2A protein abundance and long-term memory formation.",1
The U6 snRNA m(6)A Methyltransferase METTL16 Regulates SAM Synthetase Intron Retention.,"Maintenance of proper levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is critical for a wide variety of biological processes. We demonstrate that the N(6)-adenosine methyltransferase METTL16 regulates expression of human MAT2A, which encodes the SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. Upon SAM depletion by methionine starvation, cells induce MAT2A expression by enhanced splicing of a retained intron. Induction requires METTL16 and its methylation substrate, a vertebrate conserved hairpin (hp1) in the MAT2A 3' UTR. Increasing METTL16 occupancy on the MAT2A 3' UTR is sufficient to induce efficient splicing. We propose that, under SAM-limiting conditions, METTL16 occupancy on hp1 increases due to inefficient enzymatic turnover, which promotes MAT2A splicing. We further show that METTL16 is the long-unknown methyltransferase for the U6 spliceosomal small nuclear RNA (snRNA). These observations suggest that the conserved U6 snRNA methyltransferase evolved an additional function in vertebrates to regulate SAM homeostasis.",1
The Logic of the 26S Proteasome.,"The ubiquitin proteasome pathway is responsible for most of the protein degradation in mammalian cells. Rates of degradation by this pathway have generally been assumed to be determined by rates of ubiquitylation. However, recent studies indicate that proteasome function is also tightly regulated and determines whether a ubiquitylated protein is destroyed or deubiquitylated and survives longer. This article reviews recent advances in our understanding of the proteasome's multistep ATP-dependent mechanism, its biochemical and structural features that ensure efficient proteolysis and ubiquitin recycling while preventing nonselective proteolysis, and the regulation of proteasome activity by interacting proteins and subunit modifications, especially phosphorylation.",1
"Lamina-Associated Domains: Links with Chromosome Architecture, Heterochromatin, and Gene Repression.","In metazoan cell nuclei, hundreds of large chromatin domains are in close contact with the nuclear lamina. Such lamina-associated domains (LADs) are thought to help organize chromosomes inside the nucleus and have been associated with gene repression. Here, we discuss the properties of LADs, the molecular mechanisms that determine their association with the nuclear lamina, their dynamic links with other nuclear compartments, and their proposed roles in gene regulation.",1
Lung Cancer: A Wily Genetic Opponent.,"In two companion reports, the TRACERx consortium investigates tumor heterogeneity and evolution in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

Ebolavirus's Foibles.,"Ebola virus disease poses a global health threat. Here, two studies by Wec et al. and Zhao et al. identified vulnerability in an internal fusion loop of an ebolavirus glycoprotein. Monoclonal antibodies elicited from immunization and isolated from a human survivor that recognized epitopes in this area neutralized all five ebolaviruses, guiding the development of a pan-ebolavirus immunotherapy.",1
Silicon Valley Meets Biomedical Research in the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.,"The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropy launched by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, drew attention with its stated goal of helping to ""cure, manage, or treat all diseases"" by the end of the century. They intend to do it through funding basic research and addressing gaps in biomedical technology.",1
Representations of Novelty and Familiarity in a Mushroom Body Compartment.,"Animals exhibit a behavioral response to novel sensory stimuli about which they have no prior knowledge. We have examined the neural and behavioral correlates of novelty and familiarity in the olfactory system of Drosophila. Novel odors elicit strong activity in output neurons (MBONs) of the alpha'3 compartment of the mushroom body that is rapidly suppressed upon repeated exposure to the same odor. This transition in neural activity upon familiarization requires odor-evoked activity in the dopaminergic neuron innervating this compartment. Moreover, exposure of a fly to novel odors evokes an alerting response that can also be elicited by optogenetic activation of alpha'3 MBONs. Silencing these MBONs eliminates the alerting behavior. These data suggest that the alpha'3 compartment plays a causal role in the behavioral response to novel and familiar stimuli as a consequence of dopamine-mediated plasticity at the Kenyon cell-MBONalpha'3 synapse.",1
Metabolic Phenotypes of Response to Vaccination in Humans.,"Herpes zoster (shingles) causes significant morbidity in immune compromised hosts and older adults. Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4(+) T cells yet limited CD8(+) T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.",1
An Atomic Structure of the Human Spliceosome.,"Mechanistic understanding of pre-mRNA splicing requires detailed structural information on various states of the spliceosome. Here we report the cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human spliceosome just before exon ligation (the C( *) complex) at an average resolution of 3.76 A. The splicing factor Prp17 stabilizes the active site conformation. The step II factor Slu7 adopts an extended conformation, binds Prp8 and Cwc22, and is poised for selection of the 3'-splice site. Remarkably, the intron lariat traverses through a positively charged central channel of RBM22; this unusual organization suggests mechanisms of intron recruitment, confinement, and release. The protein PRKRIP1 forms a 100-A alpha helix linking the distant U2 snRNP to the catalytic center. A 35-residue fragment of the ATPase/helicase Prp22 latches onto Prp8, and the quaternary exon junction complex (EJC) recognizes upstream 5'-exon sequences and associates with Cwc22 and the GTPase Snu114. These structural features reveal important mechanistic insights into exon ligation.",1
Tracing the Enterococci from Paleozoic Origins to the Hospital.,"We examined the evolutionary history of leading multidrug resistant hospital pathogens, the enterococci, to their origin hundreds of millions of years ago. Our goal was to understand why, among the vast diversity of gut flora, enterococci are so well adapted to the modern hospital environment. Molecular clock estimation, together with analysis of their environmental distribution, phenotypic diversity, and concordance with host fossil records, place the origins of the enterococci around the time of animal terrestrialization, 425-500 mya. Speciation appears to parallel the diversification of hosts, including the rapid emergence of new enterococcal species following the End Permian Extinction. Major drivers of speciation include changing carbohydrate availability in the host gut. Life on land would have selected for the precise traits that now allow pathogenic enterococci to survive desiccation, starvation, and disinfection in the modern hospital, foreordaining their emergence as leading hospital pathogens.",1
Vitamin A-Retinoic Acid Signaling Regulates Hematopoietic Stem Cell Dormancy.,"Dormant hematopoietic stem cells (dHSCs) are atop the hematopoietic hierarchy. The molecular identity of dHSCs and the mechanisms regulating their maintenance or exit from dormancy remain uncertain. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to show that the transition from dormancy toward cell-cycle entry is a continuous developmental path associated with upregulation of biosynthetic processes rather than a stepwise progression. In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc. Mice maintained on a vitamin A-free diet lose HSCs and show a disrupted re-entry into dormancy after exposure to inflammatory stress stimuli. Our results highlight the impact of dietary vitamin A on the regulation of cell-cycle-mediated stem cell plasticity. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1

Innate Immune Landscape in Early Lung Adenocarcinoma by Paired Single-Cell Analyses.,"To guide the design of immunotherapy strategies for patients with early stage lung tumors, we developed a multiscale immune profiling strategy to map the immune landscape of early lung adenocarcinoma lesions to search for tumor-driven immune changes. Utilizing a barcoding method that allows a simultaneous single-cell analysis of the tumor, non-involved lung, and blood cells, we provide a detailed immune cell atlas of early lung tumors. We show that stage I lung adenocarcinoma lesions already harbor significantly altered T cell and NK cell compartments. Moreover, we identified changes in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell (TIM) subsets that likely compromise anti-tumor T cell immunity. Paired single-cell analyses thus offer valuable knowledge of tumor-driven immune changes, providing a powerful tool for the rational design of immune therapies. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
An Immune Atlas of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment modulate cancer progression and are attractive therapeutic targets. Macrophages and T cells are key components of the microenvironment, yet their phenotypes and relationships in this ecosystem and to clinical outcomes are ill defined. We used mass cytometry with extensive antibody panels to perform in-depth immune profiling of samples from 73 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients and five healthy controls. In 3.5 million measured cells, we identified 17 tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes, 22 T cell phenotypes, and a distinct immune composition correlated with progression-free survival, thereby presenting an in-depth human atlas of the immune tumor microenvironment in this disease. This study revealed potential biomarkers and targets for immunotherapy development and validated tools that can be used for immune profiling of other tumor types.",1
Molecular Mechanism of Substrate Processing by the Cdc48 ATPase Complex.,"The Cdc48 ATPase and its cofactors Ufd1/Npl4 (UN) extract polyubiquitinated proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes, but how they perform these functions is unclear. Cdc48 consists of an N-terminal domain that binds UN and two stacked hexameric ATPase rings (D1 and D2) surrounding a central pore. Here, we use purified components to elucidate how the Cdc48 complex processes substrates. After interaction of the polyubiquitin chain with UN, ATP hydrolysis by the D2 ring moves the polypeptide completely through the double ring, generating a pulling force on the substrate and causing its unfolding. ATP hydrolysis by the D1 ring is important for subsequent substrate release from the Cdc48 complex. This release requires cooperation of Cdc48 with a deubiquitinase, which trims polyubiquitin to an oligoubiquitin chain that is then also translocated through the pore. Together, these results lead to a new paradigm for the function of Cdc48 and its mammalian ortholog p97/VCP.",1
The Cohesin Release Factor WAPL Restricts Chromatin Loop Extension.,"The spatial organization of chromosomes influences many nuclear processes including gene expression. The cohesin complex shapes the 3D genome by looping together CTCF sites along chromosomes. We show here that chromatin loop size can be increased and that the duration with which cohesin embraces DNA determines the degree to which loops are enlarged. Cohesin's DNA release factor WAPL restricts this loop extension and also prevents looping between incorrectly oriented CTCF sites. We reveal that the SCC2/SCC4 complex promotes the extension of chromatin loops and the formation of topologically associated domains (TADs). Our data support the model that cohesin structures chromosomes through the processive enlargement of loops and that TADs reflect polyclonal collections of loops in the making. Finally, we find that whereas cohesin promotes chromosomal looping, it rather limits nuclear compartmentalization. We conclude that the balanced activity of SCC2/SCC4 and WAPL enables cohesin to correctly structure chromosomes.",1
The RNA Exosome Syncs IAV-RNAPII Transcription to Promote Viral Ribogenesis and Infectivity.,"The nuclear RNA exosome is an essential multi-subunit complex that controls RNA homeostasis. Congenital mutations in RNA exosome genes are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Little is known about the role of the RNA exosome in the cellular response to pathogens. Here, using NGS and human and mouse genetics, we show that influenza A virus (IAV) ribogenesis and growth are suppressed by impaired RNA exosome activity. Mechanistically, the nuclear RNA exosome coordinates the initial steps of viral transcription with RNAPII at host promoters. The viral polymerase complex co-opts the nuclear RNA exosome complex and cellular RNAs en route to 3' end degradation. Exosome deficiency uncouples chromatin targeting of the viral polymerase complex and the formation of cellular:viral RNA hybrids, which are essential RNA intermediates that license transcription of antisense genomic viral RNAs. Our results suggest that evolutionary arms races have shaped the cellular RNA quality control machinery.",1
SLERT Regulates DDX21 Rings Associated with Pol I Transcription.,"Dysregulated rRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation. Here, we report a box H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)-ended long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that enhances pre-rRNA transcription (SLERT). SLERT requires box H/ACA snoRNAs at both ends for its biogenesis and translocation to the nucleolus. Deletion of SLERT impairs pre-rRNA transcription and rRNA production, leading to decreased tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, SLERT interacts with DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 via a 143-nt non-snoRNA sequence. Super-resolution images reveal that DDX21 forms ring-shaped structures surrounding multiple Pol I complexes and suppresses pre-rRNA transcription. Binding by SLERT allosterically alters individual DDX21 molecules, loosens the DDX21 ring, and evicts DDX21 suppression on Pol I transcription. Together, our results reveal an important control of ribosome biogenesis by SLERT lncRNA and its regulatory role in DDX21 ring-shaped arrangements acting on Pol I complexes.",1
Diurnal Oscillations in Liver Mass and Cell Size Accompany Ribosome Assembly Cycles.,"The liver plays a pivotal role in metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification, processes that must be particularly efficient when animals are active and feed. A major question is how the liver adapts to these diurnal changes in physiology. Here, we show that, in mice, liver mass, hepatocyte size, and protein levels follow a daily rhythm, whose amplitude depends on both feeding-fasting and light-dark cycles. Correlative evidence suggests that the daily oscillation in global protein accumulation depends on a similar fluctuation in ribosome number. Whereas rRNA genes are transcribed at similar rates throughout the day, some newly synthesized rRNAs are polyadenylated and degraded in the nucleus in a robustly diurnal fashion with a phase opposite to that of ribosomal protein synthesis. Based on studies with cultured fibroblasts, we propose that rRNAs not packaged into complete ribosomal subunits are polyadenylated by the poly(A) polymerase PAPD5 and degraded by the nuclear exosome.",1
Regulation of Cerebral Cortex Folding by Controlling Neuronal Migration via FLRT Adhesion Molecules.,"The folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex into sulci and gyri is thought to be favored by the amplification of basal progenitor cells and their tangential migration. Here, we provide a molecular mechanism for the role of migration in this process by showing that changes in intercellular adhesion of migrating cortical neurons result in cortical folding. Mice with deletions of FLRT1 and FLRT3 adhesion molecules develop macroscopic sulci with preserved layered organization and radial glial morphology. Cortex folding in these mutants does not require progenitor cell amplification but is dependent on changes in neuron migration. Analyses and simulations suggest that sulcus formation in the absence of FLRT1/3 results from reduced intercellular adhesion, increased neuron migration, and clustering in the cortical plate. Notably, FLRT1/3 expression is low in the human cortex and in future sulcus areas of ferrets, suggesting that intercellular adhesion is a key regulator of cortical folding across species.",1
Recurrent Potent Human Neutralizing Antibodies to Zika Virus in Brazil and Mexico.,"Antibodies to Zika virus (ZIKV) can be protective. To examine the antibody response in individuals who develop high titers of anti-ZIKV antibodies, we screened cohorts in Brazil and Mexico for ZIKV envelope domain III (ZEDIII) binding and neutralization. We find that serologic reactivity to dengue 1 virus (DENV1) EDIII before ZIKV exposure is associated with increased ZIKV neutralizing titers after exposure. Antibody cloning shows that donors with high ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers have expanded clones of memory B cells that express the same immunoglobulin VH3-23/VK1-5 genes. These recurring antibodies cross-react with DENV1, but not other flaviviruses, neutralize both DENV1 and ZIKV, and protect mice against ZIKV challenge. Structural analyses reveal the mechanism of recognition of the ZEDIII lateral ridge by VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies. Serologic testing shows that antibodies to this region correlate with serum neutralizing activity to ZIKV. Thus, high neutralizing responses to ZIKV are associated with pre-existing reactivity to DENV1 in humans.",1
Communication in the Phytobiome.,"The phytobiome is composed of plants, their environment, and diverse interacting microscopic and macroscopic organisms, which together influence plant health and productivity. These organisms form complex networks that are established and regulated through nutrient cycling, competition, antagonism, and chemical communication mediated by a diverse array of signaling molecules. Integration of knowledge of signaling mechanisms with that of phytobiome members and their networks will lead to a new understanding of the fate and significance of these signals at the ecosystem level. Such an understanding could lead to new biological, chemical, and breeding strategies to improve crop health and productivity.",1
Metabolic Instruction of Immunity.,"Choices have consequences. Immune cells survey and migrate throughout the body and sometimes take residence in niche environments with distinct communities of cells, extracellular matrix, and nutrients that may differ from those in which they matured. Imbedded in immune cell physiology are metabolic pathways and metabolites that not only provide energy and substrates for growth and survival, but also instruct effector functions, differentiation, and gene expression. This review of immunometabolism will reference the most recent literature to cover the choices that environments impose on the metabolism and function of immune cells and highlight their consequences during homeostasis and disease.",1
Heavy Metal Enlightens Tumor Immunity.,"A deep understanding of the immune landscape in human cancer is essential for guiding the development of immunotherapy to benefit more patients with long-lasting efficacy. Now, two studies from Lavin et al. and Chevrier et al. employ mass cytometry to study immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, respectively.",1
Ribosomes Need Straight A's to Sleep.,"Like falling asleep and waking up, many biological processes in mammals cycle in a diurnal fashion. Now, Sinturel et al. demonstrate that diurnal size changes in the liver require eating during a mouse's normal awake time and that these size changes are controlled by a nuclear mechanism that modulates ribosome production.",1
Don't Stop Re-healin'! Cancer as an Ongoing Stem Cell Affair.,"Tumors have long been suspected of hijacking stem cell mechanisms used for tissue maintenance and repair. Ge et al. now show that skin tumors exhibit merged chromatin profiles from distinct stem cell lineages. This ""lineage infidelity"" recreates a state akin to transient wound repair that persists to maintain uncontrolled growth.",1
Zika Virus Persistence in the Central Nervous System and Lymph Nodes of Rhesus Monkeys.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with severe neuropathology in neonates as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurologic disorders in adults. Prolonged viral shedding has been reported in semen, suggesting the presence of anatomic viral reservoirs. Here we show that ZIKV can persist in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lymph nodes (LN) of infected rhesus monkeys for weeks after virus has been cleared from peripheral blood, urine, and mucosal secretions. ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies correlated with rapid clearance of virus in peripheral blood but remained undetectable in CSF for the duration of the study. Viral persistence in both CSF and LN correlated with upregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), proinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, as well as downregulation of extracellular matrix signaling pathways. These data raise the possibility that persistent or occult neurologic and lymphoid disease may occur following clearance of peripheral virus in ZIKV-infected individuals.",1
Cryo-EM Structure of a Relaxase Reveals the Molecular Basis of DNA Unwinding during Bacterial Conjugation.,"Relaxases play essential roles in conjugation, the main process by which bacteria exchange genetic material, notably antibiotic resistance genes. They are bifunctional enzymes containing a trans-esterase activity, which is responsible for nicking the DNA strand to be transferred and for covalent attachment to the resulting 5'-phosphate end, and a helicase activity, which is responsible for unwinding the DNA while it is being transported to a recipient cell. Here we show that these two activities are carried out by two conformers that can both load simultaneously on the origin of transfer DNA. We solve the structure of one of these conformers by cryo electron microscopy to near-atomic resolution, elucidating the molecular basis of helicase function by relaxases and revealing insights into the mechanistic events taking place in the cell prior to substrate transport during conjugation.",1
Stem Cell Lineage Infidelity Drives Wound Repair and Cancer.,"Tissue stem cells contribute to tissue regeneration and wound repair through cellular programs that can be hijacked by cancer cells. Here, we investigate such a phenomenon in skin, where during homeostasis, stem cells of the epidermis and hair follicle fuel their respective tissues. We find that breakdown of stem cell lineage confinement-granting privileges associated with both fates-is not only hallmark but also functional in cancer development. We show that lineage plasticity is critical in wound repair, where it operates transiently to redirect fates. Investigating mechanism, we discover that irrespective of cellular origin, lineage infidelity occurs in wounding when stress-responsive enhancers become activated and override homeostatic enhancers that govern lineage specificity. In cancer, stress-responsive transcription factor levels rise, causing lineage commanders to reach excess. When lineage and stress factors collaborate, they activate oncogenic enhancers that distinguish cancers from wounds.",1
Engineered Regulatory Systems Modulate Gene Expression of Human Commensals in the Gut.,"The gut microbiota is implicated in numerous aspects of health and disease, but dissecting these connections is challenging because genetic tools for gut anaerobes are limited. Inducible promoters are particularly valuable tools because these platforms allow real-time analysis of the contribution of microbiome gene products to community assembly, host physiology, and disease. We developed a panel of tunable expression platforms for the prominent genus Bacteroides in which gene expression is controlled by a synthetic inducer. In the absence of inducer, promoter activity is fully repressed; addition of inducer rapidly increases gene expression by four to five orders of magnitude. Because the inducer is absent in mice and their diets, Bacteroides gene expression inside the gut can be modulated by providing the inducer in drinking water. We use this system to measure the dynamic relationship between commensal sialidase activity and liberation of mucosal sialic acid, a receptor and nutrient for pathogens. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Tunable Expression Tools Enable Single-Cell Strain Distinction in the Gut Microbiome.,"Applying synthetic biology to engineer gut-resident microbes provides new avenues to investigate microbe-host interactions, perform diagnostics, and deliver therapeutics. Here, we describe a platform for engineering Bacteroides, the most abundant genus in the Western microbiota, which includes a process for high-throughput strain modification. We have identified a novel phage promoter and translational tuning strategy and achieved an unprecedented level of expression that enables imaging of fluorescent-protein-expressing Bacteroides stably colonizing the mouse gut. A detailed characterization of the phage promoter has provided a set of constitutive promoters that span over four logs of strength without detectable fitness burden within the gut over 14 days. These promoters function predictably over a 1,000,000-fold expression range in phylogenetically diverse Bacteroides species. With these promoters, unique fluorescent signatures were encoded to allow differentiation of six species within the gut. Fluorescent protein-based differentiation of isogenic strains revealed that priority of gut colonization determines colonic crypt occupancy.",1
Nuclear Proximity of Mtr4 to RNA Exosome Restricts DNA Mutational Asymmetry.,"The distribution of sense and antisense strand DNA mutations on transcribed duplex DNA contributes to the development of immune and neural systems along with the progression of cancer. Because developmentally matured B cells undergo biologically programmed strand-specific DNA mutagenesis at focal DNA/RNA hybrid structures, they make a convenient system to investigate strand-specific mutagenesis mechanisms. We demonstrate that the sense and antisense strand DNA mutagenesis at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and some other regions of the B cell genome depends upon localized RNA processing protein complex formation in the nucleus. Both the physical proximity and coupled activities of RNA helicase Mtr4 (and senataxin) with the noncoding RNA processing function of RNA exosome determine the strand-specific distribution of DNA mutations. Our study suggests that strand-specific DNA mutagenesis-associated mechanisms will play major roles in other undiscovered aspects of organismic development.",1
Macrophages Facilitate Electrical Conduction in the Heart.,"Organ-specific functions of tissue-resident macrophages in the steady-state heart are unknown. Here, we show that cardiac macrophages facilitate electrical conduction through the distal atrioventricular node, where conducting cells densely intersperse with elongated macrophages expressing connexin 43. When coupled to spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes via connexin-43-containing gap junctions, cardiac macrophages have a negative resting membrane potential and depolarize in synchrony with cardiomyocytes. Conversely, macrophages render the resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes more positive and, according to computational modeling, accelerate their repolarization. Photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing macrophages improves atrioventricular conduction, whereas conditional deletion of connexin 43 in macrophages and congenital lack of macrophages delay atrioventricular conduction. In the Cd11b(DTR) mouse, macrophage ablation induces progressive atrioventricular block. These observations implicate macrophages in normal and aberrant cardiac conduction.",1
Spontaneous Chitin Accumulation in Airways and Age-Related Fibrotic Lung Disease.,"The environmentally widespread polysaccharide chitin is degraded and recycled by ubiquitous bacterial and fungal chitinases. Although vertebrates express active chitinases from evolutionarily conserved loci, their role in mammalian physiology is unclear. We show that distinct lung epithelial cells secrete acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), which is required for airway chitinase activity. AMCase-deficient mice exhibit premature morbidity and mortality, concomitant with accumulation of environmentally derived chitin polymers in the airways and expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines. Over time, these mice develop spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, which is ameliorated by restoration of lung chitinase activity by genetic or therapeutic approaches. AMCase-deficient epithelial cells express fibrosis-associated gene sets linked with cell stress pathways. Mice with lung fibrosis due to telomere dysfunction and humans with interstitial lung disease also accumulate excess chitin polymers in their airways. These data suggest that altered chitin clearance could exacerbate fibrogenic pathways in the setting of lung diseases characterized by epithelial cell dysfunction.",1
The Ubiquitin Ligase CHIP Integrates Proteostasis and Aging by Regulation of Insulin Receptor Turnover.,"Aging is attended by a progressive decline in protein homeostasis (proteostasis), aggravating the risk for protein aggregation diseases. To understand the coordination between proteome imbalance and longevity, we addressed the mechanistic role of the quality-control ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which is a key regulator of proteostasis. We observed that CHIP deficiency leads to increased levels of the insulin receptor (INSR) and reduced lifespan of worms and flies. The membrane-bound INSR regulates the insulin and IGF1 signaling (IIS) pathway and thereby defines metabolism and aging. INSR is a direct target of CHIP, which triggers receptor monoubiquitylation and endocytic-lysosomal turnover to promote longevity. However, upon proteotoxic stress conditions and during aging, CHIP is recruited toward disposal of misfolded proteins, reducing its capacity to degrade the INSR. Our study indicates a competitive relationship between proteostasis and longevity regulation through CHIP-assisted proteolysis, providing a mechanistic concept for understanding the impact of proteome imbalance on aging.",1
Fatty Acids Regulate Germline Sex Determination through ACS-4-Dependent Myristoylation.,"Fat metabolism has been linked to fertility and reproductive adaptation in animals and humans, and environmental sex determination potentially plays a role in the process. To investigate the impact of fatty acids (FA) on sex determination and reproductive development, we examined and observed an impact of FA synthesis and mobilization by lipolysis in somatic tissues on oocyte fate in Caenorhabditis elegans. The subsequent genetic analysis identified ACS-4, an acyl-CoA synthetase and its FA-CoA product, as key germline factors that mediate the role of FA in promoting oocyte fate through protein myristoylation. Further tests indicated that ACS-4-dependent protein myristoylation perceives and translates the FA level into regulatory cues that modulate the activities of MPK-1/MAPK and key factors in the germline sex-determination pathway. These findings, including a similar role of ACS-4 in a male/female species, uncover a likely conserved mechanism by which FA, an environmental factor, regulates sex determination and reproductive development.",1
Host-Microbe Co-metabolism Dictates Cancer Drug Efficacy in C. elegans.,"Fluoropyrimidines are the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer, but their efficacy is highly variable between patients. We queried whether gut microbes, a known source of inter-individual variability, impacted drug efficacy. Combining two tractable genetic models, the bacterium E. coli and the nematode C. elegans, we performed three-way high-throughput screens that unraveled the complexity underlying host-microbe-drug interactions. We report that microbes can bolster or suppress the effects of fluoropyrimidines through metabolic drug interconversion involving bacterial vitamin B6, B9, and ribonucleotide metabolism. Also, disturbances in bacterial deoxynucleotide pools amplify 5-FU-induced autophagy and cell death in host cells, an effect regulated by the nucleoside diphosphate kinase ndk-1. Our data suggest a two-way bacterial mediation of fluoropyrimidine effects on host metabolism, which contributes to drug efficacy. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic power of manipulating intestinal microbiota to ensure host metabolic health and treat disease.",1
Bacterial Metabolism Affects the C. elegans Response to Cancer Chemotherapeutics.,"The human microbiota greatly affects physiology and disease; however, the contribution of bacteria to the response to chemotherapeutic drugs remains poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans and its bacterial diet provide a powerful system to study host-bacteria interactions. Here, we use this system to study how bacteria affect the C. elegans response to chemotherapeutics. We find that different bacterial species can increase the response to one drug yet decrease the effect of another. We perform genetic screens in two bacterial species using three chemotherapeutic drugs: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUDR), and camptothecin (CPT). We find numerous bacterial nucleotide metabolism genes that affect drug efficacy in C. elegans. Surprisingly, we find that 5-FU and FUDR act through bacterial ribonucleotide metabolism to elicit their cytotoxic effects in C. elegans rather than by thymineless death or DNA damage. Our study provides a blueprint for characterizing the role of bacteria in the host response to chemotherapeutics.",1
Cryo-EM Structure of the Open Human Ether-a-go-go-Related K(+) Channel hERG.,"The human ether-a-go-go-related potassium channel (hERG, Kv11.1) is a voltage-dependent channel known for its role in repolarizing the cardiac action potential. hERG alteration by mutation or pharmacological inhibition produces Long QT syndrome and the lethal cardiac arrhythmia torsade de pointes. We have determined the molecular structure of hERG to 3.8 A using cryo-electron microscopy. In this structure, the voltage sensors adopt a depolarized conformation, and the pore is open. The central cavity has an atypically small central volume surrounded by four deep hydrophobic pockets, which may explain hERG's unusual sensitivity to many drugs. A subtle structural feature of the hERG selectivity filter might correlate with its fast inactivation rate, which is key to hERG's role in cardiac action potential repolarization.",1
Structural and Functional Analysis of a beta2-Adrenergic Receptor Complex with GRK5.,"The phosphorylation of agonist-occupied G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by GPCR kinases (GRKs) functions to turn off G-protein signaling and turn on arrestin-mediated signaling. While a structural understanding of GPCR/G-protein and GPCR/arrestin complexes has emerged in recent years, the molecular architecture of a GPCR/GRK complex remains poorly defined. We used a comprehensive integrated approach of cross-linking, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (MS), electron microscopy, mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and computational docking to analyze GRK5 interaction with the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR). These studies revealed a dynamic mechanism of complex formation that involves large conformational changes in the GRK5 RH/catalytic domain interface upon receptor binding. These changes facilitate contacts between intracellular loops 2 and 3 and the C terminus of the beta2AR with the GRK5 RH bundle subdomain, membrane-binding surface, and kinase catalytic cleft, respectively. These studies significantly contribute to our understanding of the mechanism by which GRKs regulate the function of activated GPCRs. PAPERCLIP.",1
AKT/PKB Signaling: Navigating the Network.,"The Ser and Thr kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), was discovered 25 years ago and has been the focus of tens of thousands of studies in diverse fields of biology and medicine. There have been many advances in our knowledge of the upstream regulatory inputs into AKT, key multifunctional downstream signaling nodes (GSK3, FoxO, mTORC1), which greatly expand the functional repertoire of AKT, and the complex circuitry of this dynamically branching and looping signaling network that is ubiquitous to nearly every cell in our body. Mouse and human genetic studies have also revealed physiological roles for the AKT network in nearly every organ system. Our comprehension of AKT regulation and functions is particularly important given the consequences of AKT dysfunction in diverse pathological settings, including developmental and overgrowth syndromes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and neurological disorders. There has also been much progress in developing AKT-selective small molecule inhibitors. Improved understanding of the molecular wiring of the AKT signaling network continues to make an impact that cuts across most disciplines of the biomedical sciences.",1
Building a Translational Microbiome Toolbox.,"Designing successful microbiota-based therapies requires in-depth understanding of the ecological foundations of this community. In this issue, two studies by Whitaker et al. and Lim et al. provide refined genetic tools for dissecting the spatial organization and temporal dynamics of bacterial communities at the single-cell and -gene levels.",1
Resident Macrophages: Near and Dear to Your Heart.,"In this issue of Cell, Hulsmans et al. identify a subset of macrophages residing within the cardiac conduction system, which orchestrates cardiac rhythm. Macrophages directly couple with cardiomyocytes, and their perturbation alters cardiac conduction, suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of resident macrophages might represent a new strategy to combat cardiac arrhythmias.",1
Reducing Recurrence of C. difficile Infection.,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is facilitated by alteration of the microbiome following antibiotic administration. Antimicrobial therapy directed against the pathogen can treat CDI. Unfortunately, approximately 20% of successfully treated patients will suffer recurrence. Bezlotoxumab, a human monoclonal antibody, binds to C. difficile toxin B (TcdB), reducing recurrence presumably by limiting epithelial damage and facilitating microbiome recovery.",1
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Micro-niches Govern Stem Cell Lineage Choices.,"Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which, through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single-cell RNA-seq, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage tracing, temporal single-cell analyses, and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged unilineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: some progenitors specify lineages immediately, whereas others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.",1
An Approach to Spatiotemporally Resolve Protein Interaction Networks in Living Cells.,"Cells operate through protein interaction networks organized in space and time. Here, we describe an approach to resolve both dimensions simultaneously by using proximity labeling mediated by engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase (APEX). APEX has been used to capture entire organelle proteomes with high temporal resolution, but its breadth of labeling is generally thought to preclude the higher spatial resolution necessary to interrogate specific protein networks. We provide a solution to this problem by combining quantitative proteomics with a system of spatial references. As proof of principle, we apply this approach to interrogate proteins engaged by G-protein-coupled receptors as they dynamically signal and traffic in response to ligand-induced activation. The method resolves known binding partners, as well as previously unidentified network components. Validating its utility as a discovery pipeline, we establish that two of these proteins promote ubiquitin-linked receptor downregulation after prolonged activation.",1
Multidimensional Tracking of GPCR Signaling via Peroxidase-Catalyzed Proximity Labeling.,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play critical roles in regulating physiological processes ranging from neurotransmission to cardiovascular function. Current methods for tracking GPCR signaling suffer from low throughput, modification or overexpression of effector proteins, and low temporal resolution. Here, we show that peroxidase-catalyzed proximity labeling can be combined with isobaric tagging and mass spectrometry to enable quantitative, time-resolved measurement of GPCR agonist response in living cells. Using this technique, termed ""GPCR-APEX,"" we track activation and internalization of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and the beta2 adrenoceptor. These receptors co-localize with a variety of G proteins even before receptor activation, and activated receptors are largely sequestered from G proteins upon internalization. Additionally, the two receptors show differing internalization kinetics, and we identify the membrane protein LMBRD2 as a potential regulator of beta2 adrenoceptor signaling, underscoring the value of a dynamic view of receptor function.",1
Transcription Impacts the Efficiency of mRNA Translation via Co-transcriptional N6-adenosine Methylation.,"Transcription and translation are two main pillars of gene expression. Due to the different timings, spots of action, and mechanisms of regulation, these processes are mainly regarded as distinct and generally uncoupled, despite serving a common purpose. Here, we sought for a possible connection between transcription and translation. Employing an unbiased screen of multiple human promoters, we identified a positive effect of TATA box on translation and a general coupling between mRNA expression and translational efficiency. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated approach, genome-wide analyses, and in vitro experiments, we show that the rate of transcription regulates the efficiency of translation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that m(6)A modification of mRNAs is co-transcriptional and depends upon the dynamics of the transcribing RNAPII. Suboptimal transcription rates lead to elevated m(6)A content, which may result in reduced translation. This study uncovers a general and widespread link between transcription and translation that is governed by epigenetic modification of mRNAs.",1
Circulating Immune Cells Mediate a Systemic RNAi-Based Adaptive Antiviral Response in Drosophila.,"Effective antiviral protection in multicellular organisms relies on both cell-autonomous and systemic immunity. Systemic immunity mediates the spread of antiviral signals from infection sites to distant uninfected tissues. In arthropods, RNA interference (RNAi) is responsible for antiviral defense. Here, we show that flies have a sophisticated systemic RNAi-based immunity mediated by macrophage-like haemocytes. Haemocytes take up dsRNA from infected cells and, through endogenous transposon reverse transcriptases, produce virus-derived complementary DNAs (vDNA). These vDNAs template de novo synthesis of secondary viral siRNAs (vsRNA), which are secreted in exosome-like vesicles. Strikingly, exosomes containing vsRNAs, purified from haemolymph of infected flies, confer passive protection against virus challenge in naive animals. Thus, similar to vertebrates, insects use immune cells to generate immunological memory in the form of stable vDNAs that generate systemic immunity, which is mediated by the vsRNA-containing exosomes.",1
ESCRT-III Acts Downstream of MLKL to Regulate Necroptotic Cell Death and Its Consequences.,"The activation of mixed lineage kinase-like (MLKL) by receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) results in plasma membrane (PM) disruption and a form of regulated necrosis, called necroptosis. Here, we show that, during necroptosis, MLKL-dependent calcium (Ca(2+)) influx and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane preceded loss of PM integrity. Activation of MLKL results in the generation of broken, PM ""bubbles"" with exposed PS that are released from the surface of the otherwise intact cell. The ESCRT-III machinery is required for formation of these bubbles and acts to sustain survival of the cell when MLKL activation is limited or reversed. Under conditions of necroptotic cell death, ESCRT-III controls the duration of plasma membrane integrity. As a consequence of the action of ESCRT-III, cells undergoing necroptosis can express chemokines and other regulatory molecules and promote antigenic cross-priming of CD8(+) T cells.",1
Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane.,"How phospholipids are trafficked between the bacterial inner and outer membranes through the hydrophilic space of the periplasm is not known. We report that members of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family form hexameric assemblies with a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport. The E. coli MCE protein, MlaD, forms a ring associated with an ABC transporter complex in the inner membrane. A soluble lipid-binding protein, MlaC, ferries lipids between MlaD and an outer membrane protein complex. In contrast, EM structures of two other E. coli MCE proteins show that YebT forms an elongated tube consisting of seven stacked MCE rings, and PqiB adopts a syringe-like architecture. Both YebT and PqiB create channels of sufficient length to span the periplasmic space. This work reveals diverse architectures of highly conserved protein-based channels implicated in the transport of lipids between the membranes of bacteria and some eukaryotic organelles.",1
Physiologic Medium Rewires Cellular Metabolism and Reveals Uric Acid as an Endogenous Inhibitor of UMP Synthase.,"A complex interplay of environmental factors impacts the metabolism of human cells, but neither traditional culture media nor mouse plasma mimic the metabolite composition of human plasma. Here, we developed a culture medium with polar metabolite concentrations comparable to those of human plasma (human plasma-like medium [HPLM]). Culture in HPLM, relative to that in traditional media, had widespread effects on cellular metabolism, including on the metabolome, redox state, and glucose utilization. Among the most prominent was an inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis-an effect traced to uric acid, which is 10-fold higher in the blood of humans than of mice and other non-primates. We find that uric acid directly inhibits uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) and consequently reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil. Thus, media that better recapitulates the composition of human plasma reveals unforeseen metabolic wiring and regulation, suggesting that HPLM should be of broad utility.",1
Derivation of Pluripotent Stem Cells with In Vivo Embryonic and Extraembryonic Potency.,"Of all known cultured stem cell types, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) sit atop the landscape of developmental potency and are characterized by their ability to generate all cell types of an adult organism. However, PSCs show limited contribution to the extraembryonic placental tissues in vivo. Here, we show that a chemical cocktail enables the derivation of stem cells with unique functional and molecular features from mice and humans, designated as extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cells, which are capable of chimerizing both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Notably, a single mouse EPS cell shows widespread chimeric contribution to both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in vivo and permits generating single-EPS-cell-derived mice by tetraploid complementation. Furthermore, human EPS cells exhibit interspecies chimeric competency in mouse conceptuses. Our findings constitute a first step toward capturing pluripotent stem cells with extraembryonic developmental potentials in culture and open new avenues for basic and translational research. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Aneuploidy Causes Non-genetic Individuality.,"Phenotypic variability is a hallmark of diseases involving chromosome gains and losses, such as Down syndrome and cancer. Allelic variances have been thought to be the sole cause of this heterogeneity. Here, we systematically examine the consequences of gaining and losing single or multiple chromosomes to show that the aneuploid state causes non-genetic phenotypic variability. Yeast cell populations harboring the same defined aneuploidy exhibit heterogeneity in cell-cycle progression and response to environmental perturbations. Variability increases with degree of aneuploidy and is partly due to gene copy number imbalances, suggesting that subtle changes in gene expression impact the robustness of biological networks and cause alternate behaviors when they occur across many genes. As inbred trisomic mice also exhibit variable phenotypes, we further propose that non-genetic individuality is a universal characteristic of the aneuploid state that may contribute to variability in presentation and treatment responses of diseases caused by aneuploidy.",1
Chromatin Architecture Emerges during Zygotic Genome Activation Independent of Transcription.,"Chromatin architecture is fundamental in regulating gene expression. To investigate when spatial genome organization is first established during development, we examined chromatin conformation during Drosophila embryogenesis and observed the emergence of chromatin architecture within a tight time window that coincides with the onset of transcription activation in the zygote. Prior to zygotic genome activation, the genome is mostly unstructured. Early expressed genes serve as nucleation sites for topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Activation of gene expression coincides with the establishment of TADs throughout the genome and co-localization of housekeeping gene clusters, which remain stable in subsequent stages of development. However, the appearance of TAD boundaries is independent of transcription and requires the transcription factor Zelda for locus-specific TAD boundary insulation. These results offer insight into when spatial organization of the genome emerges and identify a key factor that helps trigger this architecture.",1
Mutation of the Human Circadian Clock Gene CRY1 in Familial Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder.,"Patterns of daily human activity are controlled by an intrinsic circadian clock that promotes approximately 24 hr rhythms in many behavioral and physiological processes. This system is altered in delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), a common form of insomnia in which sleep episodes are shifted to later times misaligned with the societal norm. Here, we report a hereditary form of DSPD associated with a dominant coding variation in the core circadian clock gene CRY1, which creates a transcriptional inhibitor with enhanced affinity for circadian activator proteins Clock and Bmal1. This gain-of-function CRY1 variant causes reduced expression of key transcriptional targets and lengthens the period of circadian molecular rhythms, providing a mechanistic link to DSPD symptoms. The allele has a frequency of up to 0.6%, and reverse phenotyping of unrelated families corroborates late and/or fragmented sleep patterns in carriers, suggesting that it affects sleep behavior in a sizeable portion of the human population.",1
Trade-off between Transcriptome Plasticity and Genome Evolution in Cephalopods.,"RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function. PAPERCLIP.",1
Drosophilosophical: Re-thinking Adaptive Immunity in the Fly.,"For decades, flies have been a model for innate immunity. In this issue of Cell, Tassetto et al. describe a mechanism for antiviral RNAi spreading that parallels mammalian adaptive immunity through reverse-transcribed vDNA circles and the systemic dissemination of small-RNA-containing exosomes.",1
ESCRTing Necroptosis.,"Necroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that results from MLKL-mediated disruption of the cell membrane. In this issue of Cell, Gong et al. challenge the notion that MLKL activation is a point of no return by identifying mechanisms to counterbalance necroptosis, sustain plasma membrane integrity, and prolong cell viability.",1
Can We Just Say: Transcription Second?,"The striking correlation between genome topology and transcriptional activity has for decades made researchers revisit the question, ""Does form follow function, or does function follow form?"" In a new study, Hug et al. address this question by comparing the timing of zygotic genome activation to the emergence of genome structures during Drosophila embryogenesis.",1
PARP Inhibitors for Cancer Therapy.,"Rucaparib is an inhibitor of nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (inhibition of PARP-1 > PARP-2 > PARP-3), following a similar drug, Olaparib. It disrupts DNA repair and replication pathways (and possibly transcription), leading to selective killing of cancer cells with BRCA1/2 mutations. Rucaparib is approved for recurrent ovarian cancers with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2.",1
Going Public in Support of Science.,"Scientists are stepping up like never before to support science in the public arena. In big and small ways, scientists are adopting creative ideas to promote science.",1
RIPK3 Restricts Viral Pathogenesis via Cell Death-Independent Neuroinflammation.,"Receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) is an activator of necroptotic cell death, but recent work has implicated additional roles for RIPK3 in inflammatory signaling independent of cell death. However, while necroptosis has been shown to contribute to antiviral immunity, death-independent roles for RIPK3 in host defense have not been demonstrated. Using a mouse model of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, we show that RIPK3 restricts WNV pathogenesis independently of cell death. Ripk3(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced mortality compared to wild-type (WT) controls, while mice lacking the necroptotic effector MLKL, or both MLKL and caspase-8, were unaffected. The enhanced susceptibility of Ripk3(-/-) mice arose from suppressed neuronal chemokine expression and decreased central nervous system (CNS) recruitment of T lymphocytes and inflammatory myeloid cells, while peripheral immunity remained intact. These data identify pleiotropic functions for RIPK3 in the restriction of viral pathogenesis and implicate RIPK3 as a key coordinator of immune responses within the CNS.",1
Mechanism of Substrate Translocation in an Alternating Access Transporter.,"Transporters shuttle molecules across cell membranes by alternating among distinct conformational states. Fundamental questions remain about how transporters transition between states and how such structural rearrangements regulate substrate translocation. Here, we capture the translocation process by crystallography and unguided molecular dynamics simulations, providing an atomic-level description of alternating access transport. Simulations of a SWEET-family transporter initiated from an outward-open, glucose-bound structure reported here spontaneously adopt occluded and inward-open conformations. Strikingly, these conformations match crystal structures, including our inward-open structure. Mutagenesis experiments further validate simulation predictions. Our results reveal that state transitions are driven by favorable interactions formed upon closure of extracellular and intracellular ""gates"" and by an unfavorable transmembrane helix configuration when both gates are closed. This mechanism leads to tight allosteric coupling between gates, preventing them from opening simultaneously. Interestingly, the substrate appears to take a ""free ride"" across the membrane without causing major structural rearrangements in the transporter.",1
Molecular Structure of the Human CFTR Ion Channel.,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that uniquely functions as an ion channel. Here, we present a 3.9 A structure of dephosphorylated human CFTR without nucleotides, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule, precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the structural basis for CFTR's channel function.",1
Human Epistatic Interaction Controls IL7R Splicing and Increases Multiple Sclerosis Risk.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder where T cells attack neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) leading to demyelination and neurological deficits. A driver of increased MS risk is the soluble form of the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain gene (sIL7R) produced by alternative splicing of IL7R exon 6. Here, we identified the RNA helicase DDX39B as a potent activator of this exon and consequently a repressor of sIL7R, and we found strong genetic association of DDX39B with MS risk. Indeed, we showed that a genetic variant in the 5' UTR of DDX39B reduces translation of DDX39B mRNAs and increases MS risk. Importantly, this DDX39B variant showed strong genetic and functional epistasis with allelic variants in IL7R exon 6. This study establishes the occurrence of biological epistasis in humans and provides mechanistic insight into the regulation of IL7R exon 6 splicing and its impact on MS risk.",1
Bedside Back to Bench: Building Bridges between Basic and Clinical Genomic Research.,"Genome sequencing has revolutionized the diagnosis of genetic diseases. Close collaborations between basic scientists and clinical genomicists are now needed to link genetic variants with disease causation. To facilitate such collaborations, we recommend prioritizing clinically relevant genes for functional studies, developing reference variant-phenotype databases, adopting phenotype description standards, and promoting data sharing.",1
A Viral Immunoevasin Controls Innate Immunity by Targeting the Prototypical Natural Killer Cell Receptor Family.,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a key role in innate immunity by detecting alterations in self and non-self ligands via paired NK cell receptors (NKRs). Despite identification of numerous NKR-ligand interactions, physiological ligands for the prototypical NK1.1 orphan receptor remain elusive. Here, we identify a viral ligand for the inhibitory and activating NKR-P1 (NK1.1) receptors. This murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-encoded protein, m12, restrains NK cell effector function by directly engaging the inhibitory NKR-P1B receptor. However, m12 also interacts with the activating NKR-P1A/C receptors to counterbalance m12 decoy function. Structural analyses reveal that m12 sequesters a large NKR-P1 surface area via a ""polar claw"" mechanism. Polymorphisms in, and ablation of, the viral m12 protein and host NKR-P1B/C alleles impact NK cell responses in vivo. Thus, we identify the long-sought foreign ligand for this key immunoregulatory NKR family and reveal how it controls the evolutionary balance of immune recognition during host-pathogen interplay.",1
Structure Reveals Mechanisms of Viral Suppressors that Intercept a CRISPR RNA-Guided Surveillance Complex.,"Genetic conflict between viruses and their hosts drives evolution and genetic innovation. Prokaryotes evolved CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune systems for protection from viral infection, and viruses have evolved diverse anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that subvert these immune systems. The adaptive immune system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (type I-F) relies on a 350 kDa CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided surveillance complex (Csy complex) to bind foreign DNA and recruit a trans-acting nuclease for target degradation. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Csy complex bound to two different Acr proteins, AcrF1 and AcrF2, at an average resolution of 3.4 A. The structure explains the molecular mechanism for immune system suppression, and structure-guided mutations show that the Acr proteins bind to residues essential for crRNA-mediated detection of DNA. Collectively, these data provide a snapshot of an ongoing molecular arms race between viral suppressors and the immune system they target.",1
The Evolutionary Pathway to Virulence of an RNA Virus.,"Paralytic polio once afflicted almost half a million children each year. The attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV) has enabled world-wide vaccination efforts, which resulted in nearly complete control of the disease. However, poliovirus eradication is hampered globally by epidemics of vaccine-derived polio. Here, we describe a combined theoretical and experimental strategy that describes the molecular events leading from OPV to virulent strains. We discover that similar evolutionary events occur in most epidemics. The mutations and the evolutionary trajectories driving these epidemics are replicated using a simple cell-based experimental setup where the rate of evolution is intentionally accelerated. Furthermore, mutations accumulating during epidemics increase the replication fitness of the virus in cell culture and increase virulence in an animal model. Our study uncovers the evolutionary strategies by which vaccine strains become pathogenic and provides a powerful framework for rational design of safer vaccine strains and for forecasting virulence of viruses. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Rejuvenation by Therapeutic Elimination of Senescent Cells.,"In this issue of Cell, Baar et al. show how FOXO4 protects senescent cell viability by keeping p53 sequestered in nuclear bodies, preventing it from inducing apoptosis. Disrupting this interaction with an all-D amino acid peptide (FOXO4-DRI) restores p53's apoptotic role and ameliorates the consequences of senescence-associated loss of tissue homeostasis.",1
The Upsides and Downsides of Organelle Interconnectivity.,"Interconnectivity and feedback control are hallmarks of biological systems. This includes communication between organelles, which allows them to function and adapt to changing cellular environments. While the specific mechanisms for all communications remain opaque, unraveling the wiring of organelle networks is critical to understand how biological systems are built and why they might collapse, as occurs in aging. A comprehensive understanding of all the routes involved in inter-organelle communication is still lacking, but important themes are beginning to emerge, primarily in budding yeast. These routes are reviewed here in the context of sub-system proteostasis and complex adaptive systems theory.",1
SnapShot: Subcellular mRNA Localization.,"Many cells localize mRNAs to discrete locations in the cytoplasm. Coupled to local translation, this process affords precise spatial and temporal control of protein function. This SnapShot provides an overview of the key events in subcellular mRNA localization and highlights recent progress in understanding how cytoskeletal motors orchestrate mRNA trafficking.",1
Tridimensional Visualization and Analysis of Early Human Development.,"Generating a precise cellular and molecular cartography of the human embryo is essential to our understanding of the mechanisms of organogenesis in normal and pathological conditions. Here, we have combined whole-mount immunostaining, 3DISCO clearing, and light-sheet imaging to start building a 3D cellular map of the human development during the first trimester of gestation. We provide high-resolution 3D images of the developing peripheral nervous, muscular, vascular, cardiopulmonary, and urogenital systems. We found that the adult-like pattern of skin innervation is established before the end of the first trimester, showing important intra- and inter-individual variations in nerve branches. We also present evidence for a differential vascularization of the male and female genital tracts concomitant with sex determination. This work paves the way for a cellular and molecular reference atlas of human cells, which will be of paramount importance to understanding human development in health and disease. PAPERCLIP.",1
Selective Chemical Inhibition of PGC-1alpha Gluconeogenic Activity Ameliorates Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide epidemic with a medical need for additional targeted therapies. Suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP) effectively ameliorates diabetes and can be exploited for its treatment. We hypothesized that targeting PGC-1alpha acetylation in the liver, a chemical modification known to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, could be potentially used for treatment of T2D. Thus, we designed a high-throughput chemical screen platform to quantify PGC-1alpha acetylation in cells and identified small molecules that increase PGC-1alpha acetylation, suppress gluconeogenic gene expression, and reduce glucose production in hepatocytes. On the basis of potency and bioavailability, we selected a small molecule, SR-18292, that reduces blood glucose, strongly increases hepatic insulin sensitivity, and improves glucose homeostasis in dietary and genetic mouse models of T2D. These studies have important implications for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of glucose metabolism and treatment of T2D.",1
Targeted Apoptosis of Senescent Cells Restores Tissue Homeostasis in Response to Chemotoxicity and Aging.,"The accumulation of irreparable cellular damage restricts healthspan after acute stress or natural aging. Senescent cells are thought to impair tissue function, and their genetic clearance can delay features of aging. Identifying how senescent cells avoid apoptosis allows for the prospective design of anti-senescence compounds to address whether homeostasis can also be restored. Here, we identify FOXO4 as a pivot in senescent cell viability. We designed a FOXO4 peptide that perturbs the FOXO4 interaction with p53. In senescent cells, this selectively causes p53 nuclear exclusion and cell-intrinsic apoptosis. Under conditions where it was well tolerated in vivo, this FOXO4 peptide neutralized doxorubicin-induced chemotoxicity. Moreover, it restored fitness, fur density, and renal function in both fast aging Xpd(TTD/TTD) and naturally aged mice. Thus, therapeutic targeting of senescent cells is feasible under conditions where loss of health has already occurred, and in doing so tissue homeostasis can effectively be restored.",1
A Phase Separation Model for Transcriptional Control.,"Phase-separated multi-molecular assemblies provide a general regulatory mechanism to compartmentalize biochemical reactions within cells. We propose that a phase separation model explains established and recently described features of transcriptional control. These features include the formation of super-enhancers, the sensitivity of super-enhancers to perturbation, the transcriptional bursting patterns of enhancers, and the ability of an enhancer to produce simultaneous activation at multiple genes. This model provides a conceptual framework to further explore principles of gene control in mammals.",1
Structural Basis of RNA Polymerase I Transcription Initiation.,"Transcription initiation at the ribosomal RNA promoter requires RNA polymerase (Pol) I and the initiation factors Rrn3 and core factor (CF). Here, we combine X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain a molecular model for basal Pol I initiation. The three-subunit CF binds upstream promoter DNA, docks to the Pol I-Rrn3 complex, and loads DNA into the expanded active center cleft of the polymerase. DNA unwinding between the Pol I protrusion and clamp domains enables cleft contraction, resulting in an active Pol I conformation and RNA synthesis. Comparison with the Pol II system suggests that promoter specificity relies on a distinct ""bendability"" and ""meltability"" of the promoter sequence that enables contacts between initiation factors, DNA, and polymerase.",1
A DNA-Based T Cell Receptor Reveals a Role for Receptor Clustering in Ligand Discrimination.,"A T cell mounts an immune response by measuring the binding strength of its T cell receptor (TCR) for peptide-loaded MHCs (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell. How T cells convert the lifetime of the extracellular TCR-pMHC interaction into an intracellular signal remains unknown. Here, we developed a synthetic signaling system in which the extracellular domains of the TCR and pMHC were replaced with short hybridizing strands of DNA. Remarkably, T cells can discriminate between DNA ligands differing by a single base pair. Single-molecule imaging reveals that signaling is initiated when single ligand-bound receptors are converted into clusters, a time-dependent process requiring ligands with longer bound times. A computation model reveals that receptor clustering serves a kinetic proofreading function, enabling ligands with longer bound times to have disproportionally greater signaling outputs. These results suggest that spatial reorganization of receptors plays an important role in ligand discrimination in T cell signaling.",1
Experimental Evolution to Study Virus Emergence.,"Understanding how viruses adapt to new environments and acquire new phenotypes is critical for developing comprehensive responses to outbreaks. By studying the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks, Stern et al. describe how a combination of sequence analysis and experimental evolution can be used to reveal adaptive pathways.",1
Circular Concatemers of Ultra-Short DNA Segments Produce Regulatory RNAs.,"In the ciliated protozoan Paramecium tetraurelia, Piwi-associated small RNAs are generated upon the elimination of tens of thousands of short transposon-derived DNA segments as part of development. These RNAs then target complementary DNA for elimination in a positive feedback process, contributing to germline defense and genome stability. In this work, we investigate the formation of these RNAs, which we show to be transcribed directly from the short (length mode 27 bp) excised DNA segments. Our data support a mechanism whereby the concatenation and circularization of excised DNA segments provides a template for RNA production. This process allows the generation of a double-stranded RNA for Dicer-like protein cleavage to give rise to a population of small regulatory RNAs that precisely match the excised DNA sequences. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
"mTOR Signaling in Growth, Metabolism, and Disease.","The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) coordinates eukaryotic cell growth and metabolism with environmental inputs, including nutrients and growth factors. Extensive research over the past two decades has established a central role for mTOR in regulating many fundamental cell processes, from protein synthesis to autophagy, and deregulated mTOR signaling is implicated in the progression of cancer and diabetes, as well as the aging process. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of mTOR function, regulation, and importance in mammalian physiology. We also highlight how the mTOR signaling network contributes to human disease and discuss the current and future prospects for therapeutically targeting mTOR in the clinic.",1
Energy in Ancient Metabolism.,"Modern metabolism would not work without ATP and phosphate, but in primordial biochemical networks, energy currencies might have been simpler. Goldford et al. report a novel systems approach to reconstructing energetics in ancient metabolism, with very interesting results.",1
Transporters Revealed.,"The subfamily C ATP-binding cassette (ABCC) transporters mediate multidrug resistance and ion conductance regulation. Recent atomic or near-atomic resolution structures of three physiologically significant ABCC transporters (MRP1, SUR1, and CFTR), determined by using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), reveal structural details that help explain the wide functional diversity of this ABC transporter subfamily.",1
Inside the Chamber of Secrets of the Type III Secretion System.,"The bacterial type III secretion system is a specialized machine that injects effectors into eukaryotic cells to manipulate the host cell physiology. In this issue of Cell, Hu et al. use cryo-electron tomography to reveal an unprecedented level of details regarding the architecture of this machine and the conformational changes that occur during its assembly.",1
Gel or Die: Phase Separation as a Survival Strategy.,"Stress conditions trigger protein assembly by demixing from the cytoplasm, but the biological significance is still unclear. In this issue of Cell, Riback et al. report that the yeast poly(A)-binding protein 1 (Pab1) is a phase-separating stress sensor that boosts organismal fitness under physiological stress conditions.",1
Complement Component 3 Adapts the Cerebrospinal Fluid for Leptomeningeal Metastasis.,"We molecularly dissected leptomeningeal metastasis, or spread of cancer to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is a frequent and fatal condition mediated by unknown mechanisms. We selected lung and breast cancer cell lines for the ability to infiltrate and grow in CSF, a remarkably acellular, mitogen-poor metastasis microenvironment. Complement component 3 (C3) was upregulated in four leptomeningeal metastatic models and proved necessary for cancer growth within the leptomeningeal space. In human disease, cancer cells within the CSF produced C3 in correlation with clinical course. C3 expression in primary tumors was predictive of leptomeningeal relapse. Mechanistically, we found that cancer-cell-derived C3 activates the C3a receptor in the choroid plexus epithelium to disrupt the blood-CSF barrier. This effect allows plasma components, including amphiregulin, and other mitogens to enter the CSF and promote cancer cell growth. Pharmacologic interference with C3 signaling proved therapeutically beneficial in suppressing leptomeningeal metastasis in these preclinical models.",1
Systemic Human ILC Precursors Provide a Substrate for Tissue ILC Differentiation.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent innate versions of T helper and cytotoxic T cells that differentiate from committed ILC precursors (ILCPs). How ILCPs give rise to mature tissue-resident ILCs remains unclear. Here, we identify circulating and tissue ILCPs in humans that fail to express the transcription factors and cytokine outputs of mature ILCs but have these signature loci in an epigenetically poised configuration. Human ILCPs robustly generate all ILC subsets in vitro and in vivo. While human ILCPs express low levels of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor C (RORC) transcripts, these cells are found in RORC-deficient patients and retain potential for EOMES(+) natural killer (NK) cells, interferon gamma-positive (IFN-gamma(+)) ILC1s, interleukin (IL)-13(+) ILC2s, and for IL-22(+), but not for IL-17A(+) ILC3s. Our results support a model of tissue ILC differentiation (""ILC-poiesis""), whereby diverse ILC subsets are generated in situ from systemically distributed ILCPs in response to local environmental signals.",1
In Situ Molecular Architecture of the Salmonella Type III Secretion Machine.,"Type III protein secretion systems have specifically evolved to deliver bacterially encoded proteins into target eukaryotic cells. The core elements of this multi-protein machine are the envelope-associated needle complex, the inner membrane export apparatus, and a large cytoplasmic sorting platform. Here, we report a high-resolution in situ structure of the Salmonella Typhimurium type III secretion machine obtained by high-throughput cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging. Through molecular modeling and comparative analysis of machines assembled with protein-tagged components or from different deletion mutants, we determined the molecular architecture of the secretion machine in situ and localized its structural components. We also show that docking of the sorting platform results in significant conformational changes in the needle complex to provide the symmetry adaptation required for the assembly of the entire secretion machine. These studies provide major insight into the structure and assembly of a broadly distributed protein secretion machine.",1
Functional Selectivity in Cytokine Signaling Revealed Through a Pathogenic EPO Mutation.,"Cytokines are classically thought to stimulate downstream signaling pathways through monotonic activation of receptors. We describe a severe anemia resulting from a homozygous mutation (R150Q) in the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). Surprisingly, the EPO R150Q mutant shows only a mild reduction in affinity for its receptor but has altered binding kinetics. The EPO mutant is less effective at stimulating erythroid cell proliferation and differentiation, even at maximally potent concentrations. While the EPO mutant can stimulate effectors such as STAT5 to a similar extent as the wild-type ligand, there is reduced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of select downstream targets. This impairment in downstream signaling mechanistically arises from altered receptor dimerization dynamics due to extracellular binding changes. These results demonstrate how variation in a single cytokine can lead to biased downstream signaling and can thereby cause human disease. Moreover, we have defined a distinct treatable form of anemia through mutation identification and functional studies.",1
Decoupling the Functional Pleiotropy of Stem Cell Factor by Tuning c-Kit Signaling.,"Most secreted growth factors and cytokines are functionally pleiotropic because their receptors are expressed on diverse cell types. While important for normal mammalian physiology, pleiotropy limits the efficacy of cytokines and growth factors as therapeutics. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a growth factor that acts through the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase to elicit hematopoietic progenitor expansion but can be toxic when administered in vivo because it concurrently activates mast cells. We engineered a mechanism-based SCF partial agonist that impaired c-Kit dimerization, truncating downstream signaling amplitude. This SCF variant elicited biased activation of hematopoietic progenitors over mast cells in vitro and in vivo. Mouse models of SCF-mediated anaphylaxis, radioprotection, and hematopoietic expansion revealed that this SCF partial agonist retained therapeutic efficacy while exhibiting virtually no anaphylactic off-target effects. The approach of biasing cell activation by tuning signaling thresholds and outputs has applications to many dimeric receptor-ligand systems.",1
"Stress-Triggered Phase Separation Is an Adaptive, Evolutionarily Tuned Response.","In eukaryotic cells, diverse stresses trigger coalescence of RNA-binding proteins into stress granules. In vitro, stress-granule-associated proteins can demix to form liquids, hydrogels, and other assemblies lacking fixed stoichiometry. Observing these phenomena has generally required conditions far removed from physiological stresses. We show that poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1 in yeast), a defining marker of stress granules, phase separates and forms hydrogels in vitro upon exposure to physiological stress conditions. Other RNA-binding proteins depend upon low-complexity regions (LCRs) or RNA for phase separation, whereas Pab1's LCR is not required for demixing, and RNA inhibits it. Based on unique evolutionary patterns, we create LCR mutations, which systematically tune its biophysical properties and Pab1 phase separation in vitro and in vivo. Mutations that impede phase separation reduce organism fitness during prolonged stress. Poly(A)-binding protein thus acts as a physiological stress sensor, exploiting phase separation to precisely mark stress onset, a broadly generalizable mechanism.",1
5' End Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Cap in Human Cells Promotes RNA Decay through DXO-Mediated deNADding.,"Eukaryotic mRNAs generally possess a 5' end N7 methyl guanosine (m(7)G) cap that promotes their translation and stability. However, mammalian mRNAs can also carry a 5' end nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) cap that, in contrast to the m(7)G cap, does not support translation but instead promotes mRNA decay. The mammalian and fungal noncanonical DXO/Rai1 decapping enzymes efficiently remove NAD(+) caps, and cocrystal structures of DXO/Rai1 with 3'-NADP(+) illuminate the molecular mechanism for how the ""deNADding"" reaction produces NAD(+) and 5' phosphate RNA. Removal of DXO from cells increases NAD(+)-capped mRNA levels and enables detection of NAD(+)-capped intronic small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), suggesting NAD(+) caps can be added to 5'-processed termini. Our findings establish NAD(+) as an alternative mammalian RNA cap and DXO as a deNADding enzyme modulating cellular levels of NAD(+)-capped RNAs. Collectively, these data reveal that mammalian RNAs can harbor a 5' end modification distinct from the classical m(7)G cap that promotes rather than inhibits RNA decay.",1
Super-Enhancer-Mediated RNA Processing Revealed by Integrative MicroRNA Network Analysis.,"Super-enhancers are an emerging subclass of regulatory regions controlling cell identity and disease genes. However, their biological function and impact on miRNA networks are unclear. Here, we report that super-enhancers drive the biogenesis of master miRNAs crucial for cell identity by enhancing both transcription and Drosha/DGCR8-mediated primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) processing. Super-enhancers, together with broad H3K4me3 domains, shape a tissue-specific and evolutionarily conserved atlas of miRNA expression and function. CRISPR/Cas9 genomics revealed that super-enhancer constituents act cooperatively and facilitate Drosha/DGCR8 recruitment and pri-miRNA processing to boost cell-specific miRNA production. The BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 preferentially inhibits super-enhancer-directed cotranscriptional pri-miRNA processing. Furthermore, super-enhancers are characterized by pervasive interaction with DGCR8/Drosha and DGCR8/Drosha-regulated mRNA stability control, suggesting unique RNA regulation at super-enhancers. Finally, super-enhancers mark multiple miRNAs associated with cancer hallmarks. This study presents principles underlying miRNA biology in health and disease and an unrecognized higher-order property of super-enhancers in RNA processing beyond transcription.",1
Remnants of an Ancient Metabolism without Phosphate.,"Phosphate is essential for all living systems, serving as a building block of genetic and metabolic machinery. However, it is unclear how phosphate could have assumed these central roles on primordial Earth, given its poor geochemical accessibility. We used systems biology approaches to explore the alternative hypothesis that a protometabolism could have emerged prior to the incorporation of phosphate. Surprisingly, we identified a cryptic phosphate-independent core metabolism producible from simple prebiotic compounds. This network is predicted to support the biosynthesis of a broad category of key biomolecules. Its enrichment for enzymes utilizing iron-sulfur clusters, and the fact that thermodynamic bottlenecks are more readily overcome by thioester rather than phosphate couplings, suggest that this network may constitute a ""metabolic fossil"" of an early phosphate-free nonenzymatic biochemistry. Our results corroborate and expand previous proposals that a putative thioester-based metabolism could have predated the incorporation of phosphate and an RNA-based genetic system. PAPERCLIP.",1
Inefficient Crossover Maturation Underlies Elevated Aneuploidy in Human Female Meiosis.,"Meiosis is the cellular program that underlies gamete formation. For this program, crossovers between homologous chromosomes play an essential mechanical role to ensure regular segregation. We present a detailed study of crossover formation in human male and female meiosis, enabled by modeling analysis. Results suggest that recombination in the two sexes proceeds analogously and efficiently through most stages. However, specifically in female (but not male), approximately 25% of the intermediates that should mature into crossover products actually fail to do so. Further, this ""female-specific crossover maturation inefficiency"" is inferred to make major contributions to the high level of chromosome mis-segregation and resultant aneuploidy that uniquely afflicts human female oocytes (e.g., giving Down syndrome). Additionally, crossover levels on different chromosomes in the same nucleus tend to co-vary, an effect attributable to global per-nucleus modulation of chromatin loop size. Maturation inefficiency could potentially reflect an evolutionary advantage of increased aneuploidy for human females.",1
An Intestinal Organ Culture System Uncovers a Role for the Nervous System in Microbe-Immune Crosstalk.,"Investigation of host-environment interactions in the gut would benefit from a culture system that maintained tissue architecture yet allowed tight experimental control. We devised a microfabricated organ culture system that viably preserves the normal multicellular composition of the mouse intestine, with luminal flow to control perturbations (e.g., microbes, drugs). It enables studying short-term responses of diverse gut components (immune, neuronal, etc.). We focused on the early response to bacteria that induce either Th17 or RORg(+) T-regulatory (Treg) cells in vivo. Transcriptional responses partially reproduced in vivo signatures, but these microbes elicited diametrically opposite changes in expression of a neuronal-specific gene set, notably nociceptive neuropeptides. We demonstrated activation of sensory neurons by microbes, correlating with RORg(+) Treg induction. Colonic RORg(+) Treg frequencies increased in mice lacking TAC1 neuropeptide precursor and decreased in capsaicin-diet fed mice. Thus, differential engagement of the enteric nervous system may partake in bifurcating pro- or anti-inflammatory responses to microbes.",1
Toward a Global BRAIN Initiative.,"Neuroscience is entering a collaborative era in which powerful new technologies, generated by large scientific projects in many countries, will have a dramatic impact on science, medicine, and society. Coordinating these international initiatives and ensuring broad distribution of novel technologies and open accessibility of the generated data will multiply their value, while tapping creativity and expertise from every source.",1
Structural Basis of Substrate Recognition by the Multidrug Resistance Protein MRP1.,"The multidrug resistance protein MRP1 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that confers resistance to many anticancer drugs and plays a role in the disposition and efficacy of several opiates, antidepressants, statins, and antibiotics. In addition, MRP1 regulates redox homeostasis, inflammation, and hormone secretion. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we determined the molecular structures of bovine MRP1 in two conformations: an apo form at 3.5 A without any added substrate and a complex form at 3.3 A with one of its physiological substrates, leukotriene C4. These structures show that by forming a single bipartite binding site, MRP1 can recognize a spectrum of substrates with different chemical structures. We also observed large conformational changes induced by leukotriene C4, explaining how substrate binding primes the transporter for ATP hydrolysis. Structural comparison of MRP1 and P-glycoprotein advances our understanding of the common and unique properties of these two important molecules in multidrug resistance to chemotherapy.",1
SnapShot: Class 1 CRISPR-Cas Systems.,Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems are characterized by effector modules consisting of multiple subunits. Class 1 systems comprise about 90% of all CRISPR-Cas loci identified in bacteria and archaea and can target both DNA and RNA.,1
Impacts of Neanderthal-Introgressed Sequences on the Landscape of Human Gene Expression.,"Regulatory variation influencing gene expression is a key contributor to phenotypic diversity, both within and between species. Unfortunately, RNA degrades too rapidly to be recovered from fossil remains, limiting functional genomic insights about our extinct hominin relatives. Many Neanderthal sequences survive in modern humans due to ancient hybridization, providing an opportunity to assess their contributions to transcriptional variation and to test hypotheses about regulatory evolution. We developed a flexible Bayesian statistical approach to quantify allele-specific expression (ASE) in complex RNA-seq datasets. We identified widespread expression differences between Neanderthal and modern human alleles, indicating pervasive cis-regulatory impacts of introgression. Brain regions and testes exhibited significant downregulation of Neanderthal alleles relative to other tissues, consistent with natural selection influencing the tissue-specific regulatory landscape. Our study demonstrates that Neanderthal-inherited sequences are not silent remnants of ancient interbreeding but have measurable impacts on gene expression that contribute to variation in modern human phenotypes.",1
The Ancient Gamete Fusogen HAP2 Is a Eukaryotic Class II Fusion Protein.,"Sexual reproduction is almost universal in eukaryotic life and involves the fusion of male and female haploid gametes into a diploid cell. The sperm-restricted single-pass transmembrane protein HAP2-GCS1 has been postulated to function in membrane merger. Its presence in the major eukaryotic taxa-animals, plants, and protists (including important human pathogens like Plasmodium)-suggests that many eukaryotic organisms share a common gamete fusion mechanism. Here, we report combined bioinformatic, biochemical, mutational, and X-ray crystallographic studies on the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HAP2 that reveal homology to class II viral membrane fusion proteins. We further show that targeting the segment corresponding to the fusion loop by mutagenesis or by antibodies blocks gamete fusion. These results demonstrate that HAP2 is the gamete fusogen and suggest a mechanism of action akin to viral fusion, indicating a way to block Plasmodium transmission and highlighting the impact of virus-cell genetic exchanges on the evolution of eukaryotic life.",1
Multivalent Small-Molecule Pan-RAS Inhibitors.,"Design of small molecules that disrupt protein-protein interactions, including the interaction of RAS proteins and their effectors, may provide chemical probes and therapeutic agents. We describe here the synthesis and testing of potential small-molecule pan-RAS ligands, which were designed to interact with adjacent sites on the surface of oncogenic KRAS. One compound, termed 3144, was found to bind to RAS proteins using microscale thermophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry and to exhibit lethality in cells partially dependent on expression of RAS proteins. This compound was metabolically stable in liver microsomes and displayed anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse cancer models. These findings suggest that pan-RAS inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for some cancers and that structure-based design of small molecules targeting multiple adjacent sites to create multivalent inhibitors may be effective for some proteins.",1
Structure of the Adenosine A1 Receptor Reveals the Basis for Subtype Selectivity.,"The adenosine A1 receptor (A1-AR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a vital role in cardiac, renal, and neuronal processes but remains poorly targeted by current drugs. We determined a 3.2 A crystal structure of the A1-AR bound to the selective covalent antagonist, DU172, and identified striking differences to the previously solved adenosine A2A receptor (A2A-AR) structure. Mutational and computational analysis of A1-AR revealed a distinct conformation of the second extracellular loop and a wider extracellular cavity with a secondary binding pocket that can accommodate orthosteric and allosteric ligands. We propose that conformational differences in these regions, rather than amino-acid divergence, underlie drug selectivity between these adenosine receptor subtypes. Our findings provide a molecular basis for AR subtype selectivity with implications for understanding the mechanisms governing allosteric modulation of these receptors, allowing the design of more selective agents for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury, renal pathologies, and neuropathic pain.",1
An Organismal CNV Mutator Phenotype Restricted to Early Human Development.,"De novo copy number variants (dnCNVs) arising at multiple loci in a personal genome have usually been considered to reflect cancer somatic genomic instabilities. We describe a multiple dnCNV (MdnCNV) phenomenon in which individuals with genomic disorders carry five to ten constitutional dnCNVs. These CNVs originate from independent formation incidences, are predominantly tandem duplications or complex gains, exhibit breakpoint junction features reminiscent of replicative repair, and show increased de novo point mutations flanking the rearrangement junctions. The active CNV mutation shower appears to be restricted to a transient perizygotic period. We propose that a defect in the CNV formation process is responsible for the ""CNV-mutator state,"" and this state is dampened after early embryogenesis. The constitutional MdnCNV phenomenon resembles chromosomal instability in various cancers. Investigations of this phenomenon may provide unique access to understanding genomic disorders, structural variant mutagenesis, human evolution, and cancer biology.",1
Human Adaptive Immunity Rescues an Inborn Error of Innate Immunity.,"The molecular basis of the incomplete penetrance of monogenic disorders is unclear. We describe here eight related individuals with autosomal recessive TIRAP deficiency. Life-threatening staphylococcal disease occurred during childhood in the proband, but not in the other seven homozygotes. Responses to all Toll-like receptor 1/2 (TLR1/2), TLR2/6, and TLR4 agonists were impaired in the fibroblasts and leukocytes of all TIRAP-deficient individuals. However, the whole-blood response to the TLR2/6 agonist staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was abolished only in the index case individual, the only family member lacking LTA-specific antibodies (Abs). This defective response was reversed in the patient, but not in interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4)-deficient individuals, by anti-LTA monoclonal antibody (mAb). Anti-LTA mAb also rescued the macrophage response in mice lacking TIRAP, but not TLR2 or MyD88. Thus, acquired anti-LTA Abs rescue TLR2-dependent immunity to staphylococcal LTA in individuals with inherited TIRAP deficiency, accounting for incomplete penetrance. Combined TIRAP and anti-LTA Ab deficiencies underlie staphylococcal disease in this patient.",1
Fasting-Mimicking Diet Promotes Ngn3-Driven beta-Cell Regeneration to Reverse Diabetes.,"Stem-cell-based therapies can potentially reverse organ dysfunction and diseases, but the removal of impaired tissue and activation of a program leading to organ regeneration pose major challenges. In mice, a 4-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD) induces a stepwise expression of Sox17 and Pdx-1, followed by Ngn3-driven generation of insulin-producing beta cells, resembling that observed during pancreatic development. FMD cycles restore insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in both type 2 and type 1 diabetes mouse models. In human type 1 diabetes pancreatic islets, fasting conditions reduce PKA and mTOR activity and induce Sox2 and Ngn3 expression and insulin production. The effects of the FMD are reversed by IGF-1 treatment and recapitulated by PKA and mTOR inhibition. These results indicate that a FMD promotes the reprogramming of pancreatic cells to restore insulin generation in islets from T1D patients and reverse both T1D and T2D phenotypes in mouse models. PAPERCLIP.",1
Gut-Brain Cross-Talk in Metabolic Control.,"Because human energy metabolism evolved to favor adiposity over leanness, the availability of palatable, easily attainable, and calorically dense foods has led to unprecedented levels of obesity and its associated metabolic co-morbidities that appear resistant to traditional lifestyle interventions. However, recent progress identifying the molecular signaling pathways through which the brain and the gastrointestinal system communicate to govern energy homeostasis, combined with emerging insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying successful bariatric surgery, gives reason to be optimistic that novel precision medicines that mimic, enhance, and/or modulate gut-brain signaling can have unprecedented potential for stopping the obesity and type 2 diabetes pandemics.",1
What Came First-the Virus or the Egg?,Three recent studies find that the single-pass transmembrane protein HAP2 mediates gamete fusion and is remarkably similar to class II fusion proteins found in viruses such as dengue and Zika.,1
Linking Protein and RNA Function within the Same Gene.,"Exposure to ultraviolet light leads to a cell-wide DNA damage response that includes a global reduction in transcription. Williamson et al., identify a protein involved in this process as well as a noncoding RNA produced by alternative processing of RNA transcribed from the same gene that promotes recovery from the repressed state.",1
Mutational Processes Shaping the Genome in Early Human Embryos.,In-vitro-fertilized human embryos often acquire large structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. Liu et al. now show that multiple smaller copy number variations may also arise in in-vivo-conceived embryos. Analysis of these variations provides insight into the DNA mutational processes occurring in early embryos and the mechanisms underlying them.,1
Doubling Down on Mutant RAS Can MEK or Break Leukemia.,Targeting of the RAS pathway has long been a critical therapeutic challenge in oncology. Burgess et al. examine how the relative expression of mutant and wild-type KRAS modulates clonal fitness and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in a model of Kras(G12D) mutant acute myeloid leukemia and propose its use as a predictive biomarker.,1
"Postdocs, What Would You Tell Your Younger Self?",Looking back at the time spent in graduate school and postdoctoral training can be illuminating. We asked postdoctoral researchers to tell us what kind of advice they would give to their younger selves.,1
Modified mRNA Vaccines Protect against Zika Virus Infection.,"The emergence of ZIKV infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective vaccines. We engineered a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding wild-type or variant ZIKV structural genes and tested immunogenicity and protection in mice. Two doses of modified mRNA LNPs encoding prM-E genes that produced virus-like particles resulted in high neutralizing antibody titers ( approximately 1/100,000) that protected against ZIKV infection and conferred sterilizing immunity. To offset a theoretical concern of ZIKV vaccines inducing antibodies that cross-react with the related dengue virus (DENV), we designed modified prM-E RNA encoding mutations destroying the conserved fusion-loop epitope in the E protein. This variant protected against ZIKV and diminished production of antibodies enhancing DENV infection in cells or mice. A modified mRNA vaccine can prevent ZIKV disease and be adapted to reduce the risk of sensitizing individuals to subsequent exposure to DENV, should this become a clinically relevant concern.",1
Mining the Human Gut Microbiota for Immunomodulatory Organisms.,"Within the human gut reside diverse microbes coexisting with the host in a mutually advantageous relationship. Evidence has revealed the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in shaping the immune system. To date, only a few of these microbes have been shown to modulate specific immune parameters. Herein, we broadly identify the immunomodulatory effects of phylogenetically diverse human gut microbes. We monocolonized mice with each of 53 individual bacterial species and systematically analyzed host immunologic adaptation to colonization. Most microbes exerted several specialized, complementary, and redundant transcriptional and immunomodulatory effects. Surprisingly, these were independent of microbial phylogeny. Microbial diversity in the gut ensures robustness of the microbiota's ability to generate a consistent immunomodulatory impact, serving as a highly important epigenetic system. This study provides a foundation for investigation of gut microbiota-host mutualism, highlighting key players that could identify important therapeutics.",1
HSP90 Shapes the Consequences of Human Genetic Variation.,"HSP90 acts as a protein-folding buffer that shapes the manifestations of genetic variation in model organisms. Whether HSP90 influences the consequences of mutations in humans, potentially modifying the clinical course of genetic diseases, remains unknown. By mining data for >1,500 disease-causing mutants, we found a strong correlation between reduced phenotypic severity and a dominant (HSP90 >/= HSP70) increase in mutant engagement by HSP90. Examining the cancer predisposition syndrome Fanconi anemia in depth revealed that mutant FANCA proteins engaged predominantly by HSP70 had severely compromised function. In contrast, the function of less severe mutants was preserved by a dominant increase in HSP90 binding. Reducing HSP90's buffering capacity with inhibitors or febrile temperatures destabilized HSP90-buffered mutants, exacerbating FA-related chemosensitivities. Strikingly, a compensatory FANCA somatic mutation from an ""experiment of nature"" in monozygotic twins both prevented anemia and reduced HSP90 binding. These findings provide one plausible mechanism for the variable expressivity and environmental sensitivity of genetic diseases.",1
UV Irradiation Induces a Non-coding RNA that Functionally Opposes the Protein Encoded by the Same Gene.,"The transcription-related DNA damage response was analyzed on a genome-wide scale with great spatial and temporal resolution. Upon UV irradiation, a slowdown of transcript elongation and restriction of gene activity to the promoter-proximal approximately 25 kb is observed. This is associated with a shift from expression of long mRNAs to shorter isoforms, incorporating alternative last exons (ALEs) that are more proximal to the transcription start site. Notably, this includes a shift from a protein-coding ASCC3 mRNA to a shorter ALE isoform of which the RNA, rather than an encoded protein, is critical for the eventual recovery of transcription. The non-coding ASCC3 isoform counteracts the function of the protein-coding isoform, indicating crosstalk between them. Thus, the ASCC3 gene expresses both coding and non-coding transcript isoforms with opposite effects on transcription recovery after UV-induced DNA damage.",1
KRAS Allelic Imbalance Enhances Fitness and Modulates MAP Kinase Dependence in Cancer.,"Investigating therapeutic ""outliers"" that show exceptional responses to anti-cancer treatment can uncover biomarkers of drug sensitivity. We performed preclinical trials investigating primary murine acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) generated by retroviral insertional mutagenesis in Kras(G12D) ""knockin"" mice with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (PD901). One outlier AML responded and exhibited intrinsic drug resistance at relapse. Loss of wild-type (WT) Kras enhanced the fitness of the dominant clone and rendered it sensitive to MEK inhibition. Similarly, human colorectal cancer cell lines with increased KRAS mutant allele frequency were more sensitive to MAP kinase inhibition, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated replacement of WT KRAS with a mutant allele sensitized heterozygous mutant HCT116 cells to treatment. In a prospectively characterized cohort of patients with advanced cancer, 642 of 1,168 (55%) with KRAS mutations exhibited allelic imbalance. These studies demonstrate that serial genetic changes at the Kras/KRAS locus are frequent in cancer and modulate competitive fitness and MEK dependency.",1
CpG Island Hypermethylation Mediated by DNMT3A Is a Consequence of AML Progression.,"DNMT3A mutations occur in approximately 25% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The most common mutation, DNMT3A(R882H), has dominant negative activity that reduces DNA methylation activity by approximately 80% in vitro. To understand the contribution of DNMT3A-dependent methylation to leukemogenesis, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of primary leukemic and non-leukemic cells in patients with or without DNMT3A(R882) mutations. Non-leukemic hematopoietic cells with DNMT3A(R882H) displayed focal methylation loss, suggesting that hypomethylation antedates AML. Although virtually all AMLs with wild-type DNMT3A displayed CpG island hypermethylation, this change was not associated with gene silencing and was essentially absent in AMLs with DNMT3A(R882) mutations. Primary hematopoietic stem cells expanded with cytokines were hypermethylated in a DNMT3A-dependent manner, suggesting that hypermethylation may be a response to, rather than a cause of, cellular proliferation. Our findings suggest that hypomethylation is an initiating phenotype in AMLs with DNMT3A(R882), while DNMT3A-dependent CpG island hypermethylation is a consequence of AML progression.",1
SnapShot: Circulating Tumor Cells.,"Circulating tumor cells in the blood of patients are both signal flares for the existence of a tumor and harbingers of metastasis. With recent technological developments, these cells can be isolated and analyzed to provide insights into the biology of cancer spread and response to therapy and to offer new avenues for blood biomarker development.",1
The Principles of Engineering Immune Cells to Treat Cancer.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have proven that engineered immune cells can serve as a powerful new class of cancer therapeutics. Clinical experience has helped to define the major challenges that must be met to make engineered T cells a reliable, safe, and effective platform that can be deployed against a broad range of tumors. The emergence of synthetic biology approaches for cellular engineering is providing us with a broadly expanded set of tools for programming immune cells. We discuss how these tools could be used to design the next generation of smart T cell precision therapeutics.",1
"Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy.","Cancer immunotherapy can induce long lasting responses in patients with metastatic cancers of a wide range of histologies. Broadening the clinical applicability of these treatments requires an improved understanding of the mechanisms limiting cancer immunotherapy. The interactions between the immune system and cancer cells are continuous, dynamic, and evolving from the initial establishment of a cancer cell to the development of metastatic disease, which is dependent on immune evasion. As the molecular mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy are elucidated, actionable strategies to prevent or treat them may be derived to improve clinical outcomes for patients.",1
Tumorigenic and Immunosuppressive Effects of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Cancer.,"Malignant cells utilize diverse strategies that enable them to thrive under adverse conditions while simultaneously inhibiting the development of anti-tumor immune responses. Hostile microenvironmental conditions within tumor masses, such as nutrient deprivation, oxygen limitation, high metabolic demand, and oxidative stress, disturb the protein-folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby provoking a cellular state of ""ER stress."" Sustained activation of ER stress sensors endows malignant cells with greater tumorigenic, metastatic, and drug-resistant capacity. Additionally, recent studies have uncovered that ER stress responses further impede the development of protective anti-cancer immunity by manipulating the function of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we discuss the tumorigenic and immunoregulatory effects of ER stress in cancer, and we explore the concept of targeting ER stress responses to enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapies and evolving cancer immunotherapies in the clinic.",1
Emerging Biological Principles of Metastasis.,"Metastases account for the great majority of cancer-associated deaths, yet this complex process remains the least understood aspect of cancer biology. As the body of research concerning metastasis continues to grow at a rapid rate, the biological programs that underlie the dissemination and metastatic outgrowth of cancer cells are beginning to come into view. In this review we summarize the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in metastasis, with a focus on carcinomas where the most is known, and we highlight the general principles of metastasis that have begun to emerge.",1
Understanding the Intersections between Metabolism and Cancer Biology.,Transformed cells adapt metabolism to support tumor initiation and progression. Specific metabolic activities can participate directly in the process of transformation or support the biological processes that enable tumor growth. Exploiting cancer metabolism for clinical benefit requires defining the pathways that are limiting for cancer progression and understanding the context specificity of metabolic preferences and liabilities in malignant cells. Progress toward answering these questions is providing new insight into cancer biology and can guide the more effective targeting of metabolism to help patients.,1
Endogenous DNA Damage as a Source of Genomic Instability in Cancer.,"Genome instability, defined as higher than normal rates of mutation, is a double-edged sword. As a source of genetic diversity and natural selection, mutations are beneficial for evolution. On the other hand, genomic instability can have catastrophic consequences for age-related diseases such as cancer. Mutations arise either from inactivation of DNA repair pathways or in a repair-competent background due to genotoxic stress from celluar processes such as transcription and replication that overwhelm high-fidelity DNA repair. Here, we review recent studies that shed light on endogenous sources of mutation and epigenomic features that promote genomic instability during cancer evolution.",1
Transcriptional Addiction in Cancer.,"Cancer arises from genetic alterations that invariably lead to dysregulated transcriptional programs. These dysregulated programs can cause cancer cells to become highly dependent on certain regulators of gene expression. Here, we discuss how transcriptional control is disrupted by genetic alterations in cancer cells, why transcriptional dependencies can develop as a consequence of dysregulated programs, and how these dependencies provide opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions in cancer.",1
"Clonal Heterogeneity and Tumor Evolution: Past, Present, and the Future.","Intratumor heterogeneity, which fosters tumor evolution, is a key challenge in cancer medicine. Here, we review data and technologies that have revealed intra-tumor heterogeneity across cancer types and the dynamics, constraints, and contingencies inherent to tumor evolution. We emphasize the importance of macro-evolutionary leaps, often involving large-scale chromosomal alterations, in driving tumor evolution and metastasis and consider the role of the tumor microenvironment in engendering heterogeneity and drug resistance. We suggest that bold approaches to drug development, harnessing the adaptive properties of the immune-microenvironment while limiting those of the tumor, combined with advances in clinical trial-design, will improve patient outcome.",1
Applications of Immunogenomics to Cancer.,"Cancer immunogenomics originally was framed by research supporting the hypothesis that cancer mutations generated novel peptides seen as ""non-self"" by the immune system. The search for these ""neoantigens"" has been facilitated by the combination of new sequencing technologies, specialized computational analyses, and HLA binding predictions that evaluate somatic alterations in a cancer genome and interpret their ability to produce an immune-stimulatory peptide. The resulting information can characterize a tumor's neoantigen load, its cadre of infiltrating immune cell types, the T or B cell receptor repertoire, and direct the design of a personalized therapeutic.",1
Implementing Genome-Driven Oncology.,"Early successes in identifying and targeting individual oncogenic drivers, together with the increasing feasibility of sequencing tumor genomes, have brought forth the promise of genome-driven oncology care. As we expand the breadth and depth of genomic analyses, the biological and clinical complexity of its implementation will be unparalleled. Challenges include target credentialing and validation, implementing drug combinations, clinical trial designs, targeting tumor heterogeneity, and deploying technologies beyond DNA sequencing, among others. We review how contemporary approaches are tackling these challenges and will ultimately serve as an engine for biological discovery and increase our insight into cancer and its treatment.",1
"How Much Longer Will We Put Up With $100,000 Cancer Drugs?","The spiraling cost of new drugs mandates a fundamentally different approach to keep lifesaving therapies affordable for cancer patients. We call here for the formation of new relationships between academic drug discovery centers and commercial partners, which can accelerate the development of truly transformative drugs at sustainable prices.",1
Cancer Clinical Trials: The Rear-View Mirror and the Crystal Ball.,"Clinical trials are key to translating scientific advances into progress in cancer research and care. Confronted by developments in basic science, the landscape of clinical cancer research is rapidly evolving. Here, we review recent changes in clinical trials' design and conduct, and we forecast future directions toward personalized and global impact.",1
Next-Generation Sequencing of Circulating Tumor DNA for Early Cancer Detection.,"Curative therapies are most successful when cancer is diagnosed and treated at an early stage. We advocate that technological advances in next-generation sequencing of circulating, tumor-derived nucleic acids hold promise for addressing the challenge of developing safe and effective cancer screening tests.",1
Translating Germline Cancer Risk into Precision Prevention.,"Study of the biology of tumors caused by germline mutations has led to recent paradigm-changing therapy and is driving precision prevention efforts, including immune oncology and early detection research. Here, we explore recent biologic advances that are redefining the spectrum of cancers linked to various hereditary predisposition syndromes and can be leveraged to improve personalized risk assessment and develop novel interventions to prevent or intercept cancer.",1
Where is the Future of Drug Discovery for Cancer?,"With both small molecules and biologics succeeding in trials and in the clinic, the scope of drug discovery in cancer is changing. We asked a group of researchers to share their visions for how to identify new targets and how to approach taming them.",1
A Convergence of Genetics and Epigenetics in Cancer.,"What is at the forefront of the intersection of genetics and epigenetics in cancer and how do we use what we've learned to devise new cures?

Annotated excerpts from this conversation are presented below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.",1
PDGFRA Antibody for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.,"Lartruvo (olaratumab) is a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of PDGFRA. Olaratumab blocks ligand binding and thereby inhibits activation of PDGFRA kinase activity. Pre-clinically, this antibody inhibited PDGFRA-dependent tumor growth. In a randomized Phase II study, adding olaratumab to doxorubicin chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival, leading to FDA approval.",1
Getting Data Sharing Right to Help Fulfill the Promise of Cancer Genomics.,Limited access to the profusion of sequence information derived from cancer patients worldwide stymies basic research and clinical decisions. Efforts are underway to streamline and safeguard data use.,1
Gene Essentiality Profiling Reveals Gene Networks and Synthetic Lethal Interactions with Oncogenic Ras.,"The genetic dependencies of human cancers widely vary. Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling. Our findings suggest general strategies for defining mammalian gene networks and synthetic lethal interactions by exploiting the natural genetic and epigenetic diversity of human cancer cells.",1
SnapShot: The Noncanonical Inflammasome.,"This SnapShot depicts how the noncanonical inflammasome pathway is initiated and activated, as well as its effector mechanism in triggering pyroptosis and immune defenses.",1
Pathogen-Mediated Inhibition of Anorexia Promotes Host Survival and Transmission.,"Sickness-induced anorexia is a conserved behavior induced during infections. Here, we report that an intestinal pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium, inhibits anorexia by manipulating the gut-brain axis. Inhibition of inflammasome activation by the S. Typhimurium effector, SlrP, prevented anorexia caused by IL-1beta-mediated signaling to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve. Rather than compromising host defenses, pathogen-mediated inhibition of anorexia increased host survival. SlrP-mediated inhibition of anorexia prevented invasion and systemic infection by wild-type S. Typhimurium, reducing virulence while increasing transmission to new hosts, suggesting that there are trade-offs between transmission and virulence. These results clarify the complex and contextual role of anorexia in host-pathogen interactions and suggest that microbes have evolved mechanisms to modulate sickness-induced behaviors to promote health of their host and their transmission at the expense of virulence.",1
Interspecies Chimerism with Mammalian Pluripotent Stem Cells.,"Interspecies blastocyst complementation enables organ-specific enrichment of xenogenic pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derivatives. Here, we establish a versatile blastocyst complementation platform based on CRISPR-Cas9-mediated zygote genome editing and show enrichment of rat PSC-derivatives in several tissues of gene-edited organogenesis-disabled mice. Besides gaining insights into species evolution, embryogenesis, and human disease, interspecies blastocyst complementation might allow human organ generation in animals whose organ size, anatomy, and physiology are closer to humans. To date, however, whether human PSCs (hPSCs) can contribute to chimera formation in non-rodent species remains unknown. We systematically evaluate the chimeric competency of several types of hPSCs using a more diversified clade of mammals, the ungulates. We find that naive hPSCs robustly engraft in both pig and cattle pre-implantation blastocysts but show limited contribution to post-implantation pig embryos. Instead, an intermediate hPSC type exhibits higher degree of chimerism and is able to generate differentiated progenies in post-implantation pig embryos.",1
Cellular and Circuit Mechanisms Shaping the Perceptual Properties of the Primate Fovea.,"The fovea is a specialized region of the retina that dominates the visual perception of primates by providing high chromatic and spatial acuity. While the foveal and peripheral retina share a similar core circuit architecture, they exhibit profound functional differences whose mechanisms are unknown. Using intracellular recordings and structure-function analyses, we examined the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of the primate fovea. Compared to peripheral vision, the fovea displays decreased sensitivity to rapid variations in light inputs; this difference is reflected in the responses of ganglion cells, the output cells of the retina. Surprisingly, and unlike in the periphery, synaptic inhibition minimally shaped the responses of foveal midget ganglion cells. This difference in inhibition cannot however, explain the differences in the temporal sensitivity of foveal and peripheral midget ganglion cells. Instead, foveal cone photoreceptors themselves exhibited slower light responses than peripheral cones, unexpectedly linking cone signals to perceptual sensitivity.",1
The In Vivo Architecture of the Exocyst Provides Structural Basis for Exocytosis.,"The structural characterization of protein complexes in their native environment is challenging but crucial for understanding the mechanisms that mediate cellular processes. We developed an integrative approach to reconstruct the 3D architecture of protein complexes in vivo. We applied this approach to the exocyst, a hetero-octameric complex of unknown structure that is thought to tether secretory vesicles during exocytosis with a poorly understood mechanism. We engineered yeast cells to anchor the exocyst on defined landmarks and determined the position of its subunit termini at nanometer precision using fluorescence microscopy. We then integrated these positions with the structural properties of the subunits to reconstruct the exocyst together with a vesicle bound to it. The exocyst has an open hand conformation made of rod-shaped subunits that are interlaced in the core. The exocyst architecture explains how the complex can tether secretory vesicles, placing them in direct contact with the plasma membrane.",1
Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor.,"The prototypical hallucinogen LSD acts via serotonin receptors, and here we describe the crystal structure of LSD in complex with the human serotonin receptor 5-HT2B. The complex reveals conformational rearrangements to accommodate LSD, providing a structural explanation for the conformational selectivity of LSD's key diethylamide moiety. LSD dissociates exceptionally slow from both 5-HT2BR and 5-HT2AR-a major target for its psychoactivity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that LSD's slow binding kinetics may be due to a ""lid"" formed by extracellular loop 2 (EL2) at the entrance to the binding pocket. A mutation predicted to increase the mobility of this lid greatly accelerates LSD's binding kinetics and selectively dampens LSD-mediated beta-arrestin2 recruitment. This study thus reveals an unexpected binding mode of LSD; illuminates key features of its kinetics, stereochemistry, and signaling; and provides a molecular explanation for LSD's actions at human serotonin receptors. PAPERCLIP.",1
The Stromal Intervention: Regulation of Immunity and Inflammation at the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Barrier.,"The immune system safeguards organ integrity by employing a balancing act of inflammatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms designed to neutralize foreign invaders and resolve injury. Maintaining or restoring a state of immune homeostasis is particularly challenging at barrier sites where constant exposure to immunogenic environmental agents may induce destructive inflammation. Recent studies underscore the role of epithelial and mesenchymal barrier cells in regulating immune cell function and local homeostatic and inflammatory responses. Here, we highlight immunoregulatory circuits engaging epithelial and mesenchymal cells in the intestine, airways, and skin and discuss how immune communications with hematopoietic cells and the microbiota orchestrate local immune homeostasis and inflammation.",1
A Red Carpet for Iron Metabolism.,"200 billion red blood cells (RBCs) are produced every day, requiring more than 2 x 10(15) iron atoms every second to maintain adequate erythropoiesis. These numbers translate into 20 mL of blood being produced each day, containing 6 g of hemoglobin and 20 mg of iron. These impressive numbers illustrate why the making and breaking of RBCs is at the heart of iron physiology, providing an ideal context to discuss recent progress in understanding the systemic and cellular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of iron homeostasis and its disorders.",1
Cryo-EM Captures the Dynamics of Ion Channel Opening.,"In this issue of Cell, Hite and MacKinnon (2017) report the open conformation structure of Slo2.2, a neuronal Na(+)-activated K(+) channel. More importantly, 3D classification of electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) images allows visualization of the structural transition that occurs as the open probability of individual channels increases with added sodium.",1
A Receptor on Acid.,"Wacker et al. report the crystal structure of LSD in complex with one of its major targets in the brain, the 5-HT2B receptor, the first such structure for any psychedelic drug. The results shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to induce hallucinations with greater duration and potency than closely related compounds.",1
The Long Tail of mRNA Regulation.,"Long stretches of RNA trail after the coding region in most eukaryotic mRNAs. These 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) hold the key for many aspects of regulated gene expression, influencing mRNA stability, protein synthesis, and ultimately protein function. Lara Szewczak asked Rachel Green, Ian Macrae, and Christine Mayr about how dynamic regulation by proteins and microRNAs works within 3' UTRs. An annotated excerpt of the conversation appears below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.",1
Engineering a Biological Revolution.,"The new field of synthetic biology promises to change health care, computer technology, the production of biofuels, and more. Students participating in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition are on the front lines of this revolution.",1
Discovery of Reactive Microbiota-Derived Metabolites that Inhibit Host Proteases.,"The gut microbiota modulate host biology in numerous ways, but little is known about the molecular mediators of these interactions. Previously, we found a widely distributed family of nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters in gut bacteria. Here, by expressing a subset of these clusters in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, we show that they encode pyrazinones and dihydropyrazinones. At least one of the 47 clusters is present in 88% of the National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (NIH HMP) stool samples, and they are transcribed under conditions of host colonization. We present evidence that the active form of these molecules is the initially released peptide aldehyde, which bears potent protease inhibitory activity and selectively targets a subset of cathepsins in human cell proteomes. Our findings show that an approach combining bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and heterologous gene cluster expression can rapidly expand our knowledge of the metabolic potential of the microbiota while avoiding the challenges of cultivating fastidious commensals.",1
"ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 Differentially Stimulate APP Transcription and Abeta Secretion.","Human apolipoprotein E (ApoE) apolipoprotein is primarily expressed in three isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4) that differ only by two residues. ApoE4 constitutes the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), ApoE3 is neutral, and ApoE2 is protective. How ApoE isoforms influence AD pathogenesis, however, remains unclear. Using ES-cell-derived human neurons, we show that ApoE secreted by glia stimulates neuronal Abeta production with an ApoE4 > ApoE3 > ApoE2 potency rank order. We demonstrate that ApoE binding to ApoE receptors activates dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK), a MAP-kinase kinase kinase that then activates MKK7 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Activated ERK1/2 induces cFos phosphorylation, stimulating the transcription factor AP-1, which in turn enhances transcription of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and thereby increases amyloid-beta levels. This molecular mechanism also regulates APP transcription in mice in vivo. Our data describe a novel signal transduction pathway in neurons whereby ApoE activates a non-canonical MAP kinase cascade that enhances APP transcription and amyloid-beta synthesis.",1
Ligand and Target Discovery by Fragment-Based Screening in Human Cells.,"Advances in the synthesis and screening of small-molecule libraries have accelerated the discovery of chemical probes for studying biological processes. Still, only a small fraction of the human proteome has chemical ligands. Here, we describe a platform that marries fragment-based ligand discovery with quantitative chemical proteomics to map thousands of reversible small molecule-protein interactions directly in human cells, many of which can be site-specifically determined. We show that fragment hits can be advanced to furnish selective ligands that affect the activity of proteins heretofore lacking chemical probes. We further combine fragment-based chemical proteomics with phenotypic screening to identify small molecules that promote adipocyte differentiation by engaging the poorly characterized membrane protein PGRMC2. Fragment-based screening in human cells thus provides an extensive proteome-wide map of protein ligandability and facilitates the coordinated discovery of bioactive small molecules and their molecular targets.",1
"Structural Titration of Slo2.2, a Na(+)-Dependent K(+) Channel.","The stable structural conformations that occur along the complete reaction coordinate for ion channel opening have never been observed. In this study, we describe the equilibrium ensemble of structures of Slo2.2, a neuronal Na(+)-activated K(+) channel, as a function of the Na(+) concentration. We find that Slo2.2 exists in multiple closed conformations whose relative occupancies are independent of Na(+) concentration. An open conformation emerges from an ensemble of closed conformations in a highly Na(+)-dependent manner, without evidence of Na(+)-dependent intermediates. In other words, channel opening is a highly concerted, switch-like process. The midpoint of the structural titration matches that of the functional titration. A maximum open conformation probability approaching 1.0 and maximum functional open probability approaching 0.7 imply that, within the class of open channels, there is a subclass that is not permeable to ions.",1
Cooperative Binding of Transcription Factors Orchestrates Reprogramming.,"Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (OSKM) reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency. To gain a mechanistic understanding of their function, we mapped OSKM-binding, stage-specific transcription factors (TFs), and chromatin states in discrete reprogramming stages and performed loss- and gain-of-function experiments. We found that OSK predominantly bind active somatic enhancers early in reprogramming and immediately initiate their inactivation genome-wide by inducing the redistribution of somatic TFs away from somatic enhancers to sites elsewhere engaged by OSK, recruiting Hdac1, and repressing the somatic TF Fra1. Pluripotency enhancer selection is a stepwise process that also begins early in reprogramming through collaborative binding of OSK at sites with high OSK-motif density. Most pluripotency enhancers are selected later in the process and require OS and other pluripotency TFs. Somatic and pluripotency TFs modulate reprogramming efficiency when overexpressed by altering OSK targeting, somatic-enhancer inactivation, and pluripotency enhancer selection. Together, our data indicate that collaborative interactions among OSK and with stage-specific TFs direct both somatic-enhancer inactivation and pluripotency-enhancer selection to drive reprogramming.",1
Systemic Immunity Is Required for Effective Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Immune responses involve coordination across cell types and tissues. However, studies in cancer immunotherapy have focused heavily on local immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate immune activity more broadly, we performed an organism-wide study in genetically engineered cancer models using mass cytometry. We analyzed immune responses in several tissues after immunotherapy by developing intuitive models for visualizing single-cell data with statistical inference. Immune activation was evident in the tumor and systemically shortly after effective therapy was administered. However, during tumor rejection, only peripheral immune cells sustained their proliferation. This systemic response was coordinated across tissues and required for tumor eradication in several immunotherapy models. An emergent population of peripheral CD4 T cells conferred protection against new tumors and was significantly expanded in patients responding to immunotherapy. These studies demonstrate the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive tumor rejection.",1
Insertions and Deletions Target Lineage-Defining Genes in Human Cancers.,"Certain cell types function as factories, secreting large quantities of one or more proteins that are central to the physiology of the respective organ. Examples include surfactant proteins in lung alveoli, albumin in liver parenchyma, and lipase in the stomach lining. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of lung adenocarcinomas revealed noncoding somatic mutational hotspots near VMP1/MIR21 and indel hotspots in surfactant protein genes (SFTPA1, SFTPB, and SFTPC). Extrapolation to other solid cancers demonstrated highly recurrent and tumor-type-specific indel hotspots targeting the noncoding regions of highly expressed genes defining certain secretory cellular lineages: albumin (ALB) in liver carcinoma, gastric lipase (LIPF) in stomach carcinoma, and thyroglobulin (TG) in thyroid carcinoma. The sequence contexts of indels targeting lineage-defining genes were significantly enriched in the AATAATD DNA motif and specific chromatin contexts, including H3K27ac and H3K36me3. Our findings illuminate a prevalent and hitherto unrecognized mutational process linking cellular lineage and cancer.",1
The Interfaces of Genetic Conflict Are Hot Spots for Innovation.,"RNA-guided Cas9 endonucleases protect bacteria from viral infection and have been creatively repurposed as programmable molecular scalpels for surgical manipulation of DNA. Now, two papers in Cell (Pawluk et al. and Rauch et al.) identify viral proteins that suppress Cas9 and may function like molecular sheaths for the Cas9 scalpel.",1
GABA Signaling Stimulates beta Cell Regeneration in Diabetic Mice.,"GABA and the antimalarial drug artemether, which acts on GABAergic pathways, can drive pancreatic cells with an alpha-cell phenotype toward a beta-cell-like phenotype. As reported in two papers (Ben-Othman et al. and Li et al.), these drugs can stimulate the production of sufficient numbers of new beta-like cells to reverse severe diabetes in mice.",1
30 Years of NF-kappaB: A Blossoming of Relevance to Human Pathobiology.,"NF-kappaB was discovered 30 years ago as a rapidly inducible transcription factor. Since that time, it has been found to have a broad role in gene induction in diverse cellular responses, particularly throughout the immune system. Here, we summarize elaborate regulatory pathways involving this transcription factor and use recent discoveries in human genetic diseases to place specific proteins within their relevant medical and biological contexts.",1
SnapShot: Class 2 CRISPR-Cas Systems.,"Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems are characterized by effector modules consisting of single, large, multidomain proteins that appear to have been derived from mobile genetic elements. Some Class 2 effector proteins, such as Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1), have been successfully repurposed for genome engineering.",1
Tyrosinase-Mediated Oxidative Coupling of Tyrosine Tags on Peptides and Proteins.,"Oxidative coupling (OC) through o-quinone intermediates has been established as an efficient and site-selective way to modify protein N-termini and the unnatural amino acid p-aminophenylalanine (paF). Recently, we reported that the tyrosinase-mediated oxidation of phenol-tagged cargo molecules is a particularly convenient method of generating o-quinones in situ. The coupling partners can be easily prepared and stored, the reaction takes place under mild conditions (phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 4 to 23 degrees C), and dissolved oxygen is the only oxidant required. Here, we show an important extension of this chemistry for the activation of tyrosine residues that project into solution from the N or C-termini of peptide and protein substrates. Generating the o-quinone electrophiles from tyrosine allows greater flexibility in choosing the nucleophilic coupling partner and expands the scope of the reaction to include C-terminal positions. We also introduce a new bacterial tyrosinase enzyme that shows improved activation for some tyrosine substrates. The efficacy of several secondary amines and aniline derivatives was evaluated in the coupling reactions, providing important information for coupling partner design. This strategy was used to modify the C-termini of an antibody scFv construct and of Protein L, a human IgG kappa light chain binding protein. The use of the modified proteins as immunolabeling agents was also demonstrated.",2
"Tough, Long-Term, Water-Resistant, and Underwater Adhesion of Low-Molecular-Weight Supramolecular Adhesives.","Modern functional adhesives have attracted considerable attention due to their reversible adhesion capacities and stimuli-responsive adhesion behavior. However, for modern functional adhesives, polymeric structures were highly necessary to realize adhesion behaviors. Supramolecular adhesives from low-molecular-weight monomers were rarely recognized. Compared with polymeric adhesive materials, it remains challenging for supramolecualr adhesive materials to realize tough adhesion on wet surfaces or even under water. In this study, a new supramolecular adhesive consisting of low-molecular-weight monomers was successfully designed and prepared. Strong and long-term adhesion performance was realized on various surfaces, with a maximum adhesion strength of 4.174 MPa. This supramolecular adhesive exhibits tough and stable adhesion properties in high-moisture and underwater environments (including seawater). Long-term underwater adhesion tests display the potential application of low-molecular-weight adhesive as a marine adhesive.",2
Probing the Local Nanoscale Heating Mechanism of a Magnetic Core in Mesoporous Silica Drug-Delivery Nanoparticles Using Fluorescence Depolarization.,"In the presence of an alternating magnetic field (AMF), a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) generates heat. Understanding the local heating mechanism of a SPION in suspension and in a mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) will advance the design of hyperthermia-based nanotheranostics and AMF-stimulated drug delivery in biomedical applications. The AMF-induced heating of single-domain SPION can be explained by the Neel relaxation (reorientation of the magnetization) or the Brownian relaxation (motion of the particle). The latter is investigated using fluorescence depolarization based on detecting the mobility-dependent polarization anisotropy (r) of two luminescence emission bands at different wavelengths corresponded to the europium-doped luminescent SPION (EuSPION) core and the silica-based intrinsically emitting shell of the core-shell MSN. The fluorescence depolarization experiments are carried out with both the free and the silica-encapsulated SPION nanoparticles with and without application of the AMF. The r value of a EuSPION core-mesoporous silica shell in the presence of the AMF does not change, indicating that no additional rotational motion of the core-shell nanoparticles is induced by the AMF, disproving the contribution of Brownian heating and thus supporting Neel relaxation as the dominant heating mechanism.",2
Rare-Earth Supported Nickel Catalysts for Alkyne Semihydrogenation: Chemo- and Regioselectivity Impacted by the Lewis Acidity and Size of the Support.,"Bimetallic catalysts of nickel(0) with a trivalent rare-earth ion or Ga(III), NiML3 (where L is [(i)Pr2PCH2NPh](-), and M is Sc, Y, La, Lu, or Ga), were investigated for the selective hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene (DPA) to (E)-stilbene. Each bimetallic complex features a relatively short Ni-M bond length, ranging from 2.3395(8) A (Ni-Ga) to 2.5732(4) A (Ni-La). The anodic peak potentials of the NiML3 complexes vary from -0.48 V to -1.23 V, where the potentials are negatively correlated with the Lewis acidity of the M(III) ion. Three catalysts, Ni-Y, Ni-Lu, and Ni-Ga, showed nearly quantitative conversions in the semihydrogenation of DPA, with NiYL3 giving the highest selectivity for (E)-stilbene. Initial rate studies were performed on the two tandem catalytic reactions: DPA hydrogenation and (Z)-stilbene isomerization. The catalytic activity in DPA hydrogenation follows the order Ni-Ga > Ni-La > Ni-Y > Ni-Lu > Ni-Sc. The ranking of catalysts by (Z)-stilbene isomerization initial rates is Ni-Ga >> Ni-Sc > Ni-Lu > Ni-Y > Ni-La. In operando (31)P and (1)H NMR studies revealed that in the presence of DPA, the Ni bimetallic complexes supported by Y, Lu, and La form the Ni(eta(2)-alkyne) intermediate, (eta(2)-PhC identical withCPh)Ni((i)Pr2PCH2NPh)2M(kappa(2)-(i)Pr2PCH2NPh). In contrast, the Ni-Ga resting state is the Ni(eta(2)-H2) species, and Ni-Sc showed no detectable binding of either substrate. Hence, the mechanism of Ni-catalyzed diphenylacetylene semihydrogenation adheres to two different kinetics: an autotandem pathway (Ni-Ga, Ni-Sc) versus temporally separated tandem reactions (Ni-Y, Ni-Lu, Ni-La). Collectively, the experimental results demonstrate that modulating a base-metal center via a covalently appended Lewis acidic support is viable for promoting selective alkyne semihydrogenation.",2
"Hydration, Solvation, and Isomerization of Methylglyoxal at the Air/Water Interface: New Mechanistic Pathways.","Aqueous-phase processing of methylglyoxal (MG) has been suggested to play a key role in the formation of secondary organic aerosols and catalyze particle growth in the atmosphere. However, the details of these processes remain speculative owing to the lack of a complete description of the physicochemical behavior of MG on atmospheric aerosols. Here, the solvation and hydrolysis of MG at the air/liquid water interface is studied via classical and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations combined with free-energy methods. Our results reveal that the polarity of the water solvent catalyzed the trans-to-cis isomerization of MG at the air/liquid water interface relative to the gas phase. Despite the presence of a hydrophobic group, MG often solvates with both the ketone and methyl groups parallel to the water interface. Analysis of the instantaneous water surface reveals that when MG is in the trans state, the methyl group repels interfacial water to maintain the planarity of the molecule, indicating that lateral and temporal inhomogeneities of interfacial environments are important for fully characterizing the solvation of MG. The counterintuitive behavior of the hydrophobic group is ascribed to a tendency to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds between MG and interfacial water while minimizing the torsional free energy. This drives MG hydration, and our simulations indicate that the formation of MG diol is catalyzed at the air/liquid water interface compared to the gas phase and occurs through nucleophilic attack of water on the carbonyl carbon.",2
Transition-State-like Planar Structures for Amine Inversion with Ultralong C-C Bonds in Diamino-o-carborane and Diamino-o-dodecahedron.,"Umbrella-like inversion of pyramidalized amines proceed through a planar transition state (TS). Stabilization of the TS through N(lone-pair) --> sigma*(C-C) ""negative hyperconjugation"" in diamino-o-carborane (1) causes rapid inversion in the amine, which results in the observation of a planarized -NH2 from the X-ray crystal structure. This proceeds through quantum mechanical tunneling across the small and narrow barrier (low pyramidalization). Tuning this secondary orbital (donor-acceptor) interaction for various derivatives of 1 and diamino-o-dodecahedron (2) provides a rational approach toward increasing dC-C to as large as 2.001, 2.011, and 1.807 A for 1b (amino oxide-o-carborane), 1i (di-N,N-dimethylamino-o-carborane), and 2g (di-N,N-diisopropylamino-o-dodecahedron), respectively.",2
"K3Ir2O6 and K16.3Ir8O30, Low-Dimensional Iridates with Infinite IrO6 Chains.","A previously unreported 1D iridate, K3Ir2O6, has been grown by a flux method in O2-rich environment, and its crystal structure was determined via single crystal structural analysis. It exhibits straight chains of face-sharing [IrO6] octahedra, which are arranged along the crystallographic c axis, separated by nonmagnetic K ions. No magnetic transitions are observed during measured range, and the material is electrically insulating. Potentially interesting electronic behavior for K3Ir2O6 is supported by electronic structure calculations. A structurally related material, K16.3Ir8O30, which displays similar fundamental geometric units but in a different spatial arrangement-zigzag chains-based on edge and face sharing [IrO6] octahedra, is also reported. Both materials are of interest for probing the properties of a 1D system with strong spin-orbit coupling.",2
Enantiomorphic Perovskite Ferroelectrics with Circularly Polarized Luminescence.,"Materials with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity have immense potential applications in molecular switches, optical sensors, information storage, asymmetric photosynthesis, 3D optical displays, biological probe, and spintronic devices. However, the achiral architectures of most of the luminophores severely limit their practical needs. Within this context, molecular ferroelectrics with striking chemical variability and structure-property flexibility bring light to the assembly of CPL-active ferroelectric materials. Herein, we report organic-inorganic perovskite enantiomorphic ferroelectrics, (R)- and (S)-3-(fluoropyrrolidinium)MnBr3, undergoing a 222F2-type ferroelectric phase transition at 273 K. Their mirror relationships are verified by both single-crystal X-ray diffraction and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). Furthermore, the corresponding Cotton effect for two chiral crystals was captured by mirror CPL activity. This may be assigned to the inducing interaction between the achiral luminescent perovskite framework and chiral organic components. As far as we know, this is the first molecular ferroelectric with CPL activity. Accordingly, this will inspire intriguing research in molecular ferroelectrics with CPL activity and holds great potential for the development of new optoelectronic devices.",2
LixNiO/Ni Heterostructure with Strong Basic Lattice Oxygen Enables Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Pt-like Activity.,"The low-cost hydrogen production from water electrolysis is crucial to the deployment of sustainable hydrogen economy but is currently constrained by the lack of active and robust electrocatalysts from earth-abundant materials. We describe here an unconventional heterostructure composed of strongly coupled Ni-deficient LixNiO nanoclusters and polycrystalline Ni nanocrystals and its exceptional activities toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes. The presence of lattice oxygen species with strong Bronsted basicity is a significant feature in such heterostructure, which spontaneously split water molecules for accelerated Volmer H-OH dissociation in neutral and alkaline HER. In combination with the intimate LixNiO and Ni interfacial junctions that generate localized hotspots for promoted hydride coupling and hydrogen desorption, the catalysts produce hydrogen at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under overpotentials of only 20, 50, and 36 mV in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, making them among the most active Pt-free catalysts developed thus far. In addition, such heterostructures also exhibited superior activity toward the hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline electrolytes.",2
Picolinate-Directed Arene meta-C-H Amination via FeCl3 Catalysis.,"Direct C-H functionalization of aromatic compounds is a powerful tool for organic synthesis; however, differentiation among the ubiquitous and often chemically similar C-H bonds remains a significant challenge. Conflation with coordinating or directing groups incorporated into the intended substrate has helped address these limitations, although access to remote sites remains limited. Herein, we report an operationally simple and sustainable direct meta-selective H2N amination of benzylic and related aromatic picolinates under conditions mild enough to modify polyfunctional and late-stage molecules.",2
"A Stable, Crystalline Beryllium Radical Cation.","The alkaline-earth elements (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) strongly favor the formation of diamagnetic compounds in the +2 oxidation state. Herein we report a paramagnetic beryllium radical cation, [(CAAC)2Be](+*) (2) [CAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene], prepared by oxidation of a zero-valent beryllium complex with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO). Compound 2 was characterized by EPR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray crystallography, and DFT calculations. Notably, the isolation of 2 represents the first s-block charged radical and the first crystalline beryllium radical.",2
"Spin Delocalization, Polarization, and London Dispersion Forces Govern the Formation of Diradical Pimers.","Some free radicals are stable enough to be isolated, but most are either unstable transient species or exist as metastable species in equilibrium with a dimeric form, usually a spin-paired sigma dimer or a pi dimer (pimer). To gain insight into the different modes of dimerization, we synthesized and evaluated a library of 15 aryl dicyanomethyl radicals in order to probe what structural and molecular parameters lead to sigma- versus pi-dimerization. We evaluated the divergent dimerization behavior by measuring the strength of each radical association by variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, determining the mode of dimerization (sigma- or pi-dimer) by UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and performing computational analysis. We evaluated three different hypotheses to explain the difference in the dimerization behavior: (1) that the dimerization behavior is dictated by radical spin densities; (2) that it is dictated by radical polarizability; (3) that it is dictated by London dispersion stabilization of the pimer. However, no single parameter model in itself was predictive. Two-parameter models incorporating either the computed degree of spin delocalization or the radical polarizability as well as computed estimates for the attractive London dispersion forces in the pi-dimers lead to improved forecasts of sigma- vs pi-dimerization mode, and suggest that a balance of spin delocalization of the isolated radical as well as attractive forces between the stacked radicals, govern the formation of diradical pimers.",2
Carbon-Defect-Driven Electroless Deposition of Pt Atomic Clusters for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution.,"Pt atomic clusters (Pt-ACs) display outstanding electrocatalytic performance because of their unique electronic structure with a large number of highly exposed surface atoms. However, the small size and large specific surface area intrinsically associated with ACs pose challenges in the synthesis and stabilization of Pt-ACs without agglomeration. Herein, we report a novel one-step carbon-defect-driven electroless deposition method to produce ultrasmall but well-defined and stable Pt-ACs supported by defective graphene (Pt-AC/DG) structures. A theoretical simulation clearly revealed that the defective regions with a lower work function and hence a higher reducing capacity compared to those of normal hexagonal sites triggered the reduction of Pt ions preferentially at the defect sites. Moreover, the strong binding energy between Pt and carbon defects effectively restricted the migration of spontaneously reduced Pt atoms to immobilize/stabilize the resultant Pt-ACs. Electrochemical analyses demonstrated the high performance of Pt-ACs in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction, showing a greatly enhanced mass activity, a high Pt utilization efficiency, and excellent stability compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts. The integration of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis with Pt-AC/DG as a cathode exhibited an excellent hydrogen generation activity and extraordinary stability (during 200 h of electrolysis) with a greatly reduced Pt usage compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts.",2
A Three-Dimensional Lead Halide Perovskite-Related Ferroelectric.,"Three-dimensional (3D) organic-inorganic lead halides represented by [CH3NH3]PbI3 perovskite have attracted great interest for their diverse functional properties and promising optoelectronic applications. However, 3D lead halides are still very rare and their ferroelectricity remains controversial. Here, we report an unprecedented 3D lead halide perovskite-related ferroelectric [2-trimethylammonioethylammonium]Pb2Cl6 ([TMAEA]Pb2Cl6), which contains a 3D lead chloride framework of corner- and edge-sharing PbCl6 octahedral, with the [TMAEA](+) cations occupying the voids of the framework. [TMAEA]Pb2Cl6 shows a ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition with the Curie temperature as high as 412 K, a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop at 293 K with a spontaneous polarization of 1 muC/cm(2), and a clear ferroelectric domain switching. To the best of our knowledge, [TMAEA]Pb2Cl6 is the first 3D lead halide showing such an excellent ferroelectricity. Additionally, it also exhibits a semiconducting property with a direct band gap of 3.43 eV. This finding enriches the family of 3D hybrid lead halides and inspires the exploration of 3D lead halide ferroelectrics.",2
Inorganic Halide Double Perovskites with Optoelectronic Properties Modulated by Sublattice Mixing.,"All-inorganic halide double perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials that are potentially more stable and less toxic than lead-containing hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite optoelectronic materials. In this work, 311 cesium chloride double perovskites (Cs2BB'Cl6) were selected from a set of 903 compounds as likely being stable on the basis of a statistically learned tolerance factor (tau) for perovskite stability. First-principles calculations on these 311 double perovskites were then performed to assess their stability and identify candidates with band gaps appropriate for optoelectronic applications. We predict that 261 of the 311 Cs2BB'Cl6 compounds are likely synthesizable on the basis of a thermodynamic analysis of their decomposition to competing compounds (decomposition enthalpy <0.05 eV/atom). Of these 261 likely synthesizable compounds, 47 contain no toxic elements and have direct or nearly direct (within 100 meV) band gaps between 1 and 3 eV, as computed with hybrid density functional theory (HSE06). Within this set, we identify the triple-alkali perovskites Cs2[Alk](+)[TM](3+)Cl6, where Alk is a group 1 alkali cation and TM is a transition-metal cation, as a class of Cs2BB'Cl6 double perovskites with remarkable optical properties, including large and tunable exciton binding energies as computed by the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method. We attribute the unusual electronic structure of these compounds to the mixing of the Alk-Cl and TM-Cl sublattices, leading to materials with small band gaps, large exciton binding energies, and absorption spectra that are strongly influenced by the identity of the transition metal. The role of the double-perovskite structure in enabling these unique properties is probed through an analysis of the electronic structures and chemical bonding of these compounds in comparison with other transition-metal and alkali transition-metal halides.",2
Efficient Solar Cells Based on Concerted Companion Dyes Containing Two Complementary Components: An Alternative Approach for Cosensitization.,"With the purpose to achieve panchromatic absorption for constructing efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the cosensitization approach of using two dyes with complementary absorption has been developed with great success. However, this approach usually requires time-consuming optimization of a number of parameters for controlling the ratio and distribution of the two coadsorbed dyes on TiO2 film, which limits the potentials of this strategy. We herein report an alternative approach for developing efficient DSSCs by designing a class of ""concerted companion dyes"" with two complementary dye components linked covalently. Thus, a newly synthesized organic dye Z2 was linked to a recently reported doubly strapped porphyrin dye XW51 through flexible chains with various lengths to afford XW60-XW63. These dyes exhibit excellent absorption and efficiencies in the range of 8.8%-11.7%. Notably, upon coadsorption with chenodeoxycholic acid, XW61 affords an impressive efficiency of 12.4%, a record for iodine electrolyte-based DSSCs, to the best of our knowledge. In addition, these dyes also exhibit the advantages of easy cell fabrication, simple optimization, as well as excellent photostability.",2
"Optical ""Blinking"" Triggered by Collisions of Single Supramolecular Assemblies of Amphiphilic Molecules with Interfaces of Liquid Crystals.","We report that incubation of aqueous dispersions of supramolecular assemblies formed by synthetic alkyl triazole-based amphiphiles against interfaces of thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs; 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl) triggers spatially localized (micrometer-scale) and transient (subsecond) flashes of light to be transmitted through the LC. Analysis of the spatiotemporal response of the LC supports our proposal that each optical ""blinking"" event results from collision of a single supramolecular assembly with the LC interface. Particle tracking at the LC interface confirmed that collision and subsequent spreading of amphiphiles at the interface generates a surface pressure-driven interfacial flow (Marangoni flow) that causes transient reorientation of LC and generation of a bright optical flash between crossed polarizers. We also found that dispersions of phospholipid vesicles cause ""blinks"". When using vesicles formed from 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC), we measured the frequency of blinking to decrease proportionally with the number density of vesicles in the aqueous phase, consistent with single vesicle events, with the lifetime of each blink dependent on vesicle size (800 +/- 80 nm to 150 +/- 30 nm). For 100 muM of DLPC, we measured vesicles with a diameter of 940 +/- 290 nm to generate 47 +/- 9 blinks min(-1) mm(-2), revealing that the fraction of vesicle collisions resulting in fusion with the LC interface is approximately 10(-3). Overall, the results in this paper unmask new nonequilibrium behaviors of amphiphiles at LC interfaces, and provide fresh approaches for exploring the dynamic interactions of supramolecular assemblies of amphiphiles with fluid interfaces at the single-event level.",2
Toward the Synthesis of a Highly Strained Hydrocarbon Belt.,"Hydrocarbon belts including fully conjugated beltarenes and their (partially) saturated analogs have fascinated chemists for decades due to their aesthetic structures, tantalizing properties, and potential applications in supramolecular chemistry and carbon nanoscience and nanotechnology. However, synthesis of hydrocarbon belts still remains a formidable challenge. We report in this communication a general approach to hydrocarbon belts and their derivatives. Closing up all four fjords of resorcin[4]arene derivatives through multiple intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions in an operationally simple one-pot reaction manner enabled efficient construction of octohydrobelt[8]arenes. Synthesis of belt[8]arene from DDQ-oxidized aromatization of octohydrobelt[8]arene under different conditions resulted in aromatization and simultaneous [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with DDQ or TCNE to produce selectively tetrahydrobelt[8]arene-DDQ2, tetrahydrobelt[8]arene-TCNE2, and belt[8]arene-DDQ4 adducts. Formation of belt[8]arene, a fully conjugated hydrocarbon belt, was observed from retro-Diels-Alder reaction of a belt[8]arene-DDQ4 adduct with laser irradiation under MALDI conditions. The new and practical synthetic method established would open an avenue to create belt-shaped molecules from easily available starting materials.",2
Sequential Spin State Transition and Intermetallic Charge Transfer in PbCoO3.,"Spin state transitions and intermetallic charge transfers can essentially change material structural and physical properties while excluding external chemical doping. However, these two effects have rarely been found to occur sequentially in a specific material. In this article, we show the realization of these two phenomena in a perovskite oxide PbCoO3 with a simple ABO3 composition under high pressure. PbCoO3 possesses a peculiar A- and B-site ordered charge distribution Pb(2+)Pb(4+)3Co(2+)2Co(3+)2O12 with insulating behavior at ambient conditions. The high spin Co(2+) gradually changes to low spin with increasing pressure up to about 15 GPa, leading to an anomalous increase of resistance magnitude. Between 15 and 30 GPa, the intermetallic charge transfer occurs between Pb(4+) and Co(2+) cations. The accumulated charge-transfer effect triggers a metal-insulator transition as well as a first-order structural phase transition toward a Tetra.-I phase at the onset of approximately 20 GPa near room temperature. On further compression over 30 GPa, the charge transfer completes, giving rise to another first-order structural transformation toward a Tetra.-II phase and the reentrant electrical insulating behavior.",2
TetrazineBox: A Structurally Transformative Toolbox.,"Synthetic macrocycles capable of undergoing allosteric regulation by responding to versatile external stimuli are the subject of increasing attention in supramolecular science. Herein, we report a structurally transformative tetracationic cyclophane containing two 3,6-bis(4-pyridyl)-l,2,4,5-tetrazine (4-bptz) units, which are linked together by two p-xylylene bridges. The cyclophane, which possesses modular redox states and structural post-modifications, can undergo two reversibly consecutive two-electron reductions, affording first its bisradical dicationic counterpart, and then subsequently the fully reduced species. Furthermore, one single-parent cyclophane can afford effectively three other new analogs through box-to-box cascade transformations, taking advantage of either reductions or an inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction. While all four new tetracationic cyclophanes adopt rigid and symmetric box-like conformations, their geometries in relation to size, shape, electronic properties, and binding affinities toward polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be readily regulated. This structurally transformative tetracationic cyclophane performs a variety of new tasks as a result of structural post-modifications, thus serving as a toolbox for probing the radical properties and generating rapidly a range of structurally diverse cyclophanes by efficient divergent syntheses. This research lays a solid foundation for the introduction of the structurally transformative tetracationic cyclophane into the realm of mechanically interlocked molecules and will provide a toolbox to construct and operate intelligent molecular machines.",2
Water Poisons H2 Activation at the Au-TiO2 Interface by Slowing Proton and Electron Transfer between Au and Titania.,"Understanding the dynamic changes at the active site during catalysis is a fundamental challenge that promises to improve catalytic properties. While performing Arrhenius studies during H2 oxidation over Au/TiO2 catalysts, we found different apparent activation energies (Eapp) depending on the feedwater pressure. This is partially attributed to changing numbers of metal-support interface (MSI) sites as water coverage changes with temperature. Constant water coverage studies showed two kinetic regimes: fast heterolytic H2 activation directly at the MSI (Eapp approximately 25 kJ/mol) and significantly slower heterolytic H2 activation mediated by water (Eapp approximately 45 kJ/mol). The two regimes had significantly different kinetics, suggesting a complicated mechanism of water poisoning. Density functional theory (DFT) showed water has minor effects on the reaction thermodynamics, primarily attributable to intrinsic differences in surface reactivity of different Au sites in the DFT model. The DFT model suggested significant surface restructuring of the TiO2 support during heterolytic H2 adsorption; evidence for this phenomenon was observed during in situ infrared spectroscopy experiments. A monolayer of water on the hydroxylated TiO2 surface increased the H2 dissociation activation barrier by approximately 0.2 eV, in good agreement the difference in experimentally measured values. DFT calculations suggested H2 activation goes through a proton-coupled electron-transfer-like mechanism. During proton transfer to a basic support hydroxyl group, electron density is distributed through the gold nanorod and partially localized on the protonated support hydroxyl group. Water slows H2 activation by slowing this H(+) transfer, forcing negative charge buildup on the Au and increasing the transition state energy.",2
Catalytic [5 + 1]-Cycloadditions of Vinylcyclopropanes and Vinylidenes.,"Polysubstituted cyclohexenes bearing 1,3 (meta) substitution patterns are challenging to access using the Diels-Alder reaction (the ortho-para rule). Here, we report a cobalt-catalyzed reductive [5 + 1]-cycloaddition between a vinylcyclopropane and a vinylidene to provide methylenecyclohexenes bearing all-meta relationships. Vinylidene equivalents are generated from 1,1-dichloroalkenes using Zn as a stoichiometric reductant. Experimental observations are consistent with a mechanism involving a cobaltacyclobutane formed from a [2 + 2]-cycloaddition between a cobalt vinylidene and a vinylcyclopropane.",2
TiO2-Assisted Halide Ion Segregation in Mixed Halide Perovskite Films.,"In metal halide perovskite solar cells, electron transport layers (ETLs) such as TiO2 dictate the overall photovoltaic performance. However, the same electron capture property of ETL indirectly impacts halide ion mobility as evident from the TiO2-assisted halide ion segregation in mixed halide perovskite (MHP) films under pulsed laser excitation (387 nm, 500 Hz). This segregation is only observed when deposited on an ETL such as TiO2 but not on insulating ZrO2 substrate. Injection of electrons from excited MHP into the ETL (ket = 10(11) s(-1)) followed by scavenging of electrons by O2 causes hole accumulation in the MHP film. Localization of holes on the iodide site in the MHP induces instability causing iodide from the lattice to move away toward grain boundaries. Suppression of segregation occurs when holes are extracted by a hole transport layer (spiro-OMeTAD) deposited on the MHP, thus avoiding hole build-up. These results provide further insight into the role of holes in the phase segregation of MHPs and hole mobility in perovskite solar cells.",2
Control of Molecular Bonding Strength on Metal Catalysts with Organic Monolayers for CO2 Reduction.,"The development of separate levers for controlling the bonding strength of different reactive species on catalyst surfaces is challenging but essential for the design of highly active and selective catalysts. For example, during CO2 reduction, production of CO often requires balancing a trade-off between the adsorption strength of the reactant and product states: weak binding of CO is desirable from a selectivity perspective, but weak binding of CO2 leads to low activity. Here, we demonstrate a new method of controlling both CO2 adsorption and CO desorption over supported metal catalysts by employing a single self-assembly step where organic monolayer films were deposited on the catalyst support. Binding of phosphonic acid monolayers on supported Pt and Pd catalysts weakened CO binding via a through-support effect. The weakened CO adsorption was generally accompanied by decreased adsorption and reactivity of CO2. However, by the incorporation of basic amine functions at controlled positions in the modifying film, strong CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation reactivity could be restored. Thus, both through-surface and through-space interactions could be manipulated by design of the organic modifiers. After surface modification, the catalysts exhibited significantly improved selectivity (up to approximately 99% at conversions near 50%) and activity toward CO production. Moreover, the rate of deactivation was notably reduced due to prevention of CO poisoning.",2
Trisaccharide Sulfate and Its Sulfonamide as an Effective Substrate and Inhibitor of Human Endo-O-sulfatase-1.,"Human endo-O-sulfatases (Sulf-1 and Sulf-2) are extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-specific 6-O-endosulfatases, which regulate a multitude of cell-signaling events through heparan sulfate (HS)-protein interactions and are associated with the onset of osteoarthritis. These endo-O-sulfatases are transported onto the cell surface to liberate the 6-sulfate groups from the internal d-glucosamine residues in the highly sulfated subdomains of HSPGs. In this study, a variety of HS oligosaccharides with different chain lengths and N- and O-sulfation patterns via chemical synthesis were systematically studied about the substrate specificity of human Sulf-1 employing the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (4-MUS) in a competition assay. The trisaccharide sulfate IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoA2S was found to be the minimal-size substrate for Sulf-1, and substitution of the sulfate group at the 6-O position of the d-glucosamine unit with the sulfonamide motif effectively inhibited the Sulf-1 activity with IC50 = 0.53 muM, Ki = 0.36 muM, and KD = 12 nM.",2
Covalent Catalysis by Cross beta Amyloid Nanotubes.,"The binding pockets of extant enzymes feature precise positioning of amino acid residues that facilitate multiple complex transformations exploiting covalent and non-covalent interactions. Reversible covalent anchoring is extensively used as an efficient tool by Nature for activating modern enzymes such as esterases and dehydratases and also for proteins like opsins for the complex process of visual phototransduction. Here we construct paracrystalline amyloid surfaces through the self-propagation of short peptides which offer binding pockets exposed with arrays of imidazoles and lysines. As covalent catalysis is utilized by modern-day enzymes, these homogeneous amyloid nanotubes exploit Schiff imine formation via the exposed lysines to efficiently hydrolyze both activated and inactivated esters. Controls where lysines were mutated with charged residues accessed similar morphologies but did not augment the rate. The designed amyloid microphases thus foreshadow the generation of binding pockets of advanced proteins and have the potential to contribute to the development of functional materials.",2
Molecular Oxygen-Induced Ferromagnetism and Half-Metallicity in alpha-BaNaO4: A First-Principles Study.,"Molecular oxygen resembles 3d and 4f metals in exhibiting long-range spin ordering and strong electron correlation behaviors in compounds. Ferromagnetic spin ordering and half-metallicity, however, are quite elusive and have not been well acknowledged. In this Article, we address this issue by studying how spins will interact with each other if the oxygen dimers are arranged in a different way from that in the known superoxides and peroxides by first-principles calculations. Based on the results of a structure search, thermodynamic studies, and lattice dynamics, we show that tetragonal alpha-BaNaO4 is a stable half-metal with a Curie temperature at 120 K, the first example in this class of compounds. Like 3d and 4f metals, the O2 dimer carries a local magnetic moment of 0.5 muB due to the unpaired electrons in its pi* orbitals. This compound can be regarded as forming from the O2 dimer layers stacking in a head-to-head way. In contrast to the arrangement in AO2 (A = K, Rb, Cs), the spins are ferromagnetically coupled both within and between the layers. Spin polarization occurs in pi* orbitals, with spin-up electrons fully occupying the valence band and spin-down electrons partially occupying the conduction band, forming semiconducting and metallic channels, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of geometric arrangement of O2 dimers in inducing ferromagnetism and other novel properties in O2-dimer-containing compounds.",2
Tunable Hydrogen Doping of Metal Oxide Semiconductors with Acid-Metal Treatment at Ambient Conditions.,"Hydrogen doping of metal oxide semiconductors is promising for manipulation of their properties toward various applications. Yet it is quite challenging because it requires harsh reaction conditions and expensive metal catalysts. Meanwhile, acids as a cheap source of protons have long been unappreciated. Here, we develop a sophisticated acid-metal treatment for tunable hydrogenation of metal oxides at ambient conditions. Using first-principles simulations, we first show that, with proper work function difference between the metal and metal oxide, H-diffusion into negatively charged metal oxide can be well controlled, resulting in tunable H-doping of metal oxides with quasi-metal characteristics. This has been verified by proof-of-concept experiments that achieved the controllable hydrogenation of WO3 using Cu and hydrochloric acid at ambient conditions. Further, H-doping of other metal oxides (TiO2/Nb2O5/MoO3) has been achieved by metal-acid treatment and induced a change in properties. Our work provides a promising way to tailor metal oxides via tunable H-doping.",2
"Rapid, Scalable Construction of Highly Crystalline Acylhydrazone Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks via Dipole-Induced Antiparallel Stacking.","Covalent organic frameworks are an emerging class of porous crystalline organic materials that can be designed and synthesized from the bottom up. Despite progress made in synthesizing COFs of diverse topologies, the synthesis methods are often tedious and unscalable, hampering practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a scalable, robust method of producing highly crystalline acylhydrazone two-dimensional (2D) COFs with diversified structures (six examples) under open and stirred conditions, with growth typically completed in only 30 min. Our strategy involves selecting molecular building blocks that have bond dipole moments with spatial orientations that favor antiparallel stacking and whose structure allows the restriction of intramolecular bond rotation (RIR) via intra- and interlayer hydrogen bonding. This method is widely applicable for hydrazide linkers containing various side-chain functionalities and topicities. By this strategy, the gram-scale synthesis of two highly crystalline COFs (up to 1.4 g yield) was obtained in a one-pot reaction within 30 min.",2
Visualization of Aluminum Ions at the Mica Water Interface Links Hydrolysis State-to-Surface Potential and Particle Adhesion.,"When hydrolyzable cations such as aluminum interact with solid-water interfaces, macroscopic interfacial properties (e.g., surface charge and potential) and interfacial phenomena (e.g., particle adhesion) become tightly linked with the microscopic details of ion adsorption and speciation. We use in situ atomic force microscopy to directly image individual aluminum ions at a mica-water interface and show how adsorbate populations change with pH and aluminum activity. Complementary streaming potential measurements then allow us to build a triple layer model (TLM) that links surface potentials to adsorbate populations, via equilibrium binding constants. Our model predicts that hydrolyzed species dominate the mica-water interface, even when unhydrolyzed species dominate the solution. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm that aluminum hydrolysis is strongly promoted at the interface. The TLM indicates that hydrolyzed adsorbates are responsible for surface-potential inversions, and we find strong correlations between hydrolyzed adsorbates and particle-adhesion forces, suggesting that these species mediate adhesion by chemical bridging.",2
Multistep Engineering of Synergistic Catalysts in a Metal-Organic Framework for Tandem C-O Bond Cleavage.,"Cleavage of strong C-O bonds without breaking C-C/C-H bonds is a key step for catalytic conversion of renewable biomass to hydrocarbon feedstocks. Herein we report multistep sequential engineering of orthogonal Lewis acid and palladium nanoparticle (NP) catalysts in a metal-organic framework (MOF) built from (Al-OH)n secondary building units and a mixture of 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylate (dcbpy) and 1,4-benzenediacrylate (pdac) ligands (1) for tandem C-O bond cleavage. Ozonolysis of 1 selectively removed pdac ligands to generate Al2(OH)(OH2) sites, which were subsequently triflated with trimethylsilyl triflate to afford strongly Lewis acidic sites for dehydroalkoxylation. Coordination of Pd(MeCN)2Cl2 to dcbpy ligands followed by in situ reduction produced orthogonal Pd NP sites in 1-OTf-Pd(NP) as the hydrogenation catalyst. The selective and precise transformation of 1 into 1-OTf-Pd(NP) was characterized step by step using powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The hierarchical incorporation of orthogonal Lewis acid and Pd NP active sites endowed 1-OTf-Pd(NP) with outstanding catalytic performance in apparent hydrogenolysis of etheric, alcoholic, and esteric C-O bonds to generate saturated alkanes via a tandem dehydroalkoxylation-hydrogenation process under relatively mild conditions. The reactivity of C-O bonds followed the trend of tertiary carbon > secondary carbon > primary carbon. Control experiments demonstrated the heterogeneous nature and recyclability of 1-OTf-Pd(NP) and its superior catalytic activity over the homogeneous counterparts. Sequential engineering of multiple catalytic sites in MOFs thus presents a unique opportunity to address outstanding challenges in sustainable catalysis.",2
Investigations into the Mechanism of Inter- and Intramolecular Iron-Catalyzed [2 + 2] Cycloaddition of Alkenes.,"Mechanistic studies are reported on the inter- and intramolecular [2 + 2] alkene cycloadditions to form cyclobutanes promoted by ((tric)PDI)Fe(N2) ((tric)PDI = 2,6-(2,4,6-tricyclopentyl)C6H2N = CMe)2C5H3N). A combination of kinetic measurements, freeze-quench (57)Fe Mossbauer and infrared spectroscopic measurements, deuterium labeling studies, natural abundance (13)C KIE studies, and isolation and characterization of catalytically relevant intermediates were used to gain insight into the mechanism of both inter- and intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. For the stereo- and regioselective [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 1-octene to form trans-1,2-dihexylcyclobutane, a first-order dependence on both iron complex and alkene was measured as well as an inverse dependence on N2 pressure. Both (57)Fe Mossbauer and infrared spectroscopic measurements identified ((tric)PDI)Fe(N2)(eta(2)-1-octene) as the catalyst resting state. Rate-determining association of 1-octene to ((tric)PDI)Fe(eta(2)-1-octene) accounts for the first order dependence of alkene and the inverse dependence on N2. Heavy atom (13)C/(12)C kinetic isotope effects near unity also support post rate-determining C-C bond formation. By contrast, the intramolecular iron-catalyzed [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 1,7-octadiene yielded cis-bicyclo[4.2.0]octane in 92:8 d.r. and a first order dependence on the iron precursor and zeroth order behavior in both diene and N2 pressure were measured. A pyridine(diimine) iron trans-bimetallacycle was identified as the catalyst resting state and was isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction and (1)H NMR and (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopies. Dissolution of the iron trans-bimetallacycle in benzene-d6 produced predominantly the cis-cyclobutane product, establishing interconversion between the trans and cis metallacycles during the catalytic reaction and consistent with a Curtin-Hammett kinetic regime. A primary (13)C/(12)C kinetic isotope effect of 1.022(4) was measured at 23 degrees C, consistent with irreversible unimolecular reductive elimination to form the cyclobutane product. Despite complications from competing cyclometalation of chelate aryl substituents, deuterium labeling experiments were consistent with unimolecular C-C reductive elimination that occurred either by a concerted pathway or a radical rebound sequence that is faster than C-C bond rotation.",2
Transient Absorption Spectroscopy Offers Mechanistic Insights for an Iridium/Nickel-Catalyzed C-O Coupling.,"We report mechanistic insights into an iridium/nickel photocatalytic C-O cross-coupling reaction from time-resolved spectroscopic studies. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, energy transfer from an iridium photocatalyst to a catalytically relevant Ni(II)(aryl) acetate acceptor was observed. Concentration-dependent lifetime measurements suggest the mechanism of the subsequent reductive elimination is a unimolecular process occurring on the long-lived excited state of the Ni(II) complex. We envision that our study of the productive energy-transfer-mediated pathway would encourage the development of new excited-state reactivities in the field of metallaphotocatalysis that are enabled by light harvesting.",2
Electrostatic Barriers to Nanoparticle Accessibility of a Porous Matrix.,"Translocation from one cavity to another through a narrow constriction (i.e., a ""hole"") represents the fundamental elementary process underlying hindered mass transport of nanoparticles and macromolecules within many natural and synthetic porous materials, including intracellular environments. This process is complex and may be influenced by long-range (e.g., electrostatic) particle-wall interactions, transient adsorption/desorption, surface diffusion, and hydrodynamic effects. Here, we used a three-dimensional (3D) tracking method to explicitly visualize the process of nanoparticle diffusion within periodic porous nanostructures, where electrostatic interactions were mediated via ionic strength. The effects of electrostatic interactions on nanoparticle transport were surprisingly large. For example, an increase in the Debye length of only a few nanometers (in a material with a hole diameter of approximately 100 nm) increased the mean cavity escape time 3-fold. A combination of computational and experimental analyses indicated that this hindered cavity escape was due to an electrostatic energy barrier in the region of the hole, which was quantitatively explained using DLVO theory. These findings explicitly demonstrate that the cavity escape process was barrier-limited and dominated by electrostatic effects.",2
"Switchable Catalysis Improves the Properties of CO2-Derived Polymers: Poly(cyclohexene carbonate-b-epsilon-decalactone-b-cyclohexene carbonate) Adhesives, Elastomers, and Toughened Plastics.","Carbon dioxide/epoxide copolymerization is an efficient way to add value to waste CO2 and to reduce pollution in polymer manufacturing. Using this process to make low molar mass polycarbonate polyols is a commercially relevant route to new thermosets and polyurethanes. In contrast, high molar mass polycarbonates, produced from CO2, generally under-deliver in terms of properties, and one of the most widely investigated, poly(cyclohexene carbonate), is limited by its low elongation at break and high brittleness. Here, a new catalytic polymerization process is reported that selectively and efficiently yields degradable ABA-block polymers, incorporating 6-23 wt % CO2. The polymers are synthesized using a new, highly active organometallic heterodinuclear Zn(II)/Mg(II) catalyst applied in a one-pot procedure together with biobased epsilon-decalactone, cyclohexene oxide, and carbon dioxide to make a series of poly(cyclohexene carbonate-b-decalactone-b-cyclohexene carbonate) [PCHC-PDL-PCHC]. The process is highly selective (CO2 selectivity >99% of theoretical value), allows for high monomer conversions (>90%), and yields polymers with predictable compositions, molar mass (from 38-71 kg mol(-1)), and forms dihydroxyl telechelic chains. These new materials improve upon the properties of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) and, specifically, they show good thermal stability (Td,5 approximately 280 degrees C), high toughness (112 MJ m(-3)), and very high elongation at break (>900%). Materials properties are improved by precisely controlling both the quantity and location of carbon dioxide in the polymer chain. Preliminary studies show that polymers are stable in aqueous environments at room temperature over months, but they are rapidly degraded upon gentle heating in an acidic environment (60 degrees C, toluene, p-toluene sulfonic acid). The process is likely generally applicable to many other lactones, lactides, anhydrides, epoxides, and heterocumulenes and sets the scene for a host of new applications for CO2-derived polymers.",2
"Versatile, Aqueous Soluble C2N Quantum Dots with Enriched Active Edges and Oxygenated Groups.","C2N has emerged as a new family of promising two-dimensional (2D) layered frameworks in both fundamental studies and potential applications. Transforming bulk C2N into zero-dimensional quantum dots (QDs) could induce unique quantum confinement and edge effects that produce improved or new properties. Despite their appealing potential, C2NQDs remain unexplored, and their intriguing properties and a fundamental understanding of their prominent edge effects are still not well understood. Here, we report the first synthesis of water-soluble C2NQDs via a top-down approach without any foreign stabilizer and exploit their linear/nonlinear optical properties and unique edge-preferential electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfides for versatile applications. The resultant dispersant-free C2NQDs with an average size of less than 5 nm feature rich oxygen-carrying groups and active edges, not only enabling excellent dispersion in water but also creating interesting multifunctionality. They can emit not only blue one-photon luminescence (OPL) under ultraviolet (UV) excitation but also green two-photon luminescence (TPL) with a wide near-infrared (NIR) excitation range of 750-900 nm, enabling their use as a new fluorescent ink. Interestingly, when C2NQDs are introduced to modify commercial separators, they can function as new metal-free catalysts to boost polysulfide redox kinetics and endow Li-S batteries with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity (7.0 mA h cm(-2)) at a high sulfur loading of 8.0 mg cm(-2). Detailed theoretical and experimental results indicate that the edge of C2N is more favorable for trapping and catalyzing the polysulfide conversion than the terrace and that the synergy between the active edges and oxygenated groups enriched in C2NQDs remarkably improves polysulfide immobilization and catalytic conversion.",2
Electron and Proton Transfers Modulate DNA Binding by the Transcription Regulator RsrR.,"The [Fe2S2]-RsrR gene transcription regulator senses the redox status in bacteria by modulating DNA binding, while its cluster cycles between +1 and +2 states-only the latter binds DNA. We have previously shown that RsrR can undergo remarkable conformational changes involving a 100 degrees rotation of tryptophan 9 between exposed (Out) and buried (In) states. Here, we have used the chemical modification of Trp9, site-directed mutagenesis, and crystallographic and computational chemical studies to show that (i) the Out and In states correspond to oxidized and reduced RsrR, respectively, (ii) His33 is protonated in the In state due to a change in its pKa caused by cluster reduction, and (iii) Trp9 rotation is conditioned by the response of its dipole moment to environmental electrostatic changes. Our findings illustrate a novel function of protonation resulting from electron transfer.",2
DNA 5-Methylcytosine-Specific Amplification and Sequencing.,"DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC)-specific mapping has been hampered by severe DNA degradation and the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) using the conventional bisulfite sequencing approach. Here, we present a 5mC-specific whole-genome amplification method (5mC-WGA), with which we achieved 5mC retention during DNA amplification from limited input down to 10 pg scale with limited interference from 5hmC signals, providing DNA 5mC methylome with high reproducibility and accuracy.",2
Enhanced Menshutkin SN2 Reactivity in Mesoporous Silica: The Influence of Surface Catalysis and Confinement.,"A significant enhancement in the Menshutkin SN2 reaction between 1-methylimidazole (MeIm) and methyl thiocyanate (MeSCN) is observed when the reaction is confined in the nanoscale silica pores of MCM41 and SBA15. The experiments in the silica pores are conducted without the surrounding bulk reaction mixture. The influences of temperature, pore radius, and surface chemistry on the kinetics of the confined reaction are analyzed with time-dependent infrared spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and ab initio calculations. The rate constant of the pseudo-first order reaction increases with decreasing pore size, and the activation energy is found to decrease by 5.6 kJ/mol in the smallest pore studied (2.8 nm) relative to the bulk reaction. The rate constant dependence on pore size is accurately described by a two-state model in which molecules within the 4.6 A interfacial layer experience a 2.4-fold rate constant increase relative to those reacting at the bulk rate further away from the interface. The removal of polar silanol groups from the silica surface via passivation with trimethylsilyl chloride results in bulk-like kinetics despite a reduction in the pore diameter, demonstrating the role of silanols as catalytic sites. Electronic structure calculations of the energy profile on a model silica surface confirm that silanol groups, particularly those of the vicinal type, can reduce the activation energy and reaction endothermicity through the donation of hydrogen bonds to the reactant, transition state, and product complexes.",2
"Optical Terpene and Terpenoid Sensing: Chiral Recognition, Determination of Enantiomeric Composition and Total Concentration Analysis with Late Transition Metal Complexes.","Quantitative chirality sensing of terpenes and terpenoids exhibiting a single double bond as the only functional group, such as alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and camphene, or two alkene moieties like limonene, valencene, and beta-caryophyllene is among the most difficult molecular recognition tasks. In this work, a fast chiroptical sensing method that accomplishes determination of the enantiomeric excess and overall amount of a large variety of terpenes and terpenoids using readily available phosphine derived late transition metal complexes is presented. The terpene coordination is complete within 10 min and coincides with spontaneous induction of strong CD signals at long wavelengths and distinct UV changes which together allow accurate ee and concentration quantification.",2
Integrating Suitable Linkage of Covalent Organic Frameworks into Covalently Bridged Inorganic/Organic Hybrids toward Efficient Photocatalysis.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are excellent platforms with tailored functionalities in photocatalysis. There are still challenges in increasing the photochemical performance of COFs. Therefore, we designed and prepared a series of COFs for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Varying different ratios of beta-ketoenamine to imine moieties in the linkages could differ the ordered structure, visible light harvesting, and bandgap. Overall, beta-ketoenamine-linked COFs exhibited much better photocatalytic activity than those COFs having both beta-ketoenamine and imine moieties on account of a nonquenched excited state and more favorable HOMO level in the photoinduced oxidation reaction from the former. Specifically, after in situ growth of beta-ketoenamine-linked COFs onto NH2-Ti3C2Tx MXene via covalent connection, the heterohybrid showed an obvious improvement in photocatalytic H2 evolution because of strong covalent coupling, electrical conductivity, and efficient charge transfer. This integrated linkage evolution and covalent hybridization approach advances the development of COF-based photocatalysts.",2
Divergent Synthesis of Antiviral Diterpenes Wickerols A and B.,"Wickerols A and B are diterpene natural products that have a novel fused 6-5-6-6 ring framework and exhibit potent antiviral activity against the H1N1 type A influenza virus. Herein, we report a divergent synthesis of wickerols A and B in 16 and 15 steps, respectively, from commercial sitolactone. The key reactions of the synthesis are a SmI2-mediated intramolecular ketone-allylic acetate reductive cyclization, a Claisen rearrangement, and an intramolecular alkylation/aldol reaction that rapidly assembled the compact tetracyclic core framework in a stereocontrolled manner. The work described herein allowed us to confirm the absolute configurations of wickerols A and B.",2
"Confinement-Driven Photophysics in Cages, Covalent-Organic Frameworks, Metal-Organic Frameworks, and DNA.","Photophysics tunability through alteration of framework aperture (metal-organic framework (MOF) = variable; guest = constant) was probed for the first time in comparison with previously explored concepts (MOF = constant; guest = variable). In particular, analysis of the confinement effect on a photophysical response of integrated 5-(3-chlorobenzylidene)-2,3-dimethyl-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-one (Cl-BI) chromophore allowed us to establish a photophysics-aperture relationship. To shed light on the observed correlation, the framework confined environment was replicated using a molecular cage, Pd6(TPT)4 (TPT = 2,4,6-tri(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine), thus allowing for utilization of crystallography, spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations to reveal the effect a confined space has on the chromophore's molecular conformation (including disruption of strong hydrogen bonding and novel conformer formation) and any associated changes on a photophysical response. Furthermore, the chosen Cl-oHBI@Pd6(TPT)4 (Cl-oHBI = 5-(5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzylidene)-2,3-dimethyl-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-one, chromophore) system was applied as a tool for targeted cargo delivery of a chromophore to the confined space of DNA, which resulted in promotion of chromophore-DNA interactions through a well-established intercalation mechanism. Moreover, the developed principles were applied toward utilizing a HBI-based chromophore as a fluorescent probe on the example of macrophage cells. For the first time, suppression of non-radiative decay pathways of a chromophore was tested by anchoring the chromophore to a framework metal node, portending a potential avenue to develop an alternative to natural biomarkers. Overall, these studies are among the first attempts to demonstrate the unrevealed potential of a confined scaffold environment for tailoring a material's photophysical response.",2
Oxidative Generation of Boron-Centered Radicals in Carboranes.,"We report the first indirect observation and use of boron vertex-centered carboranyl radicals generated by the oxidation of modified carboranyl precursors. These radical intermediates are formed by the direct oxidation of a B-B bond between a boron cluster cage and an exopolyhedral boron-based substituent (e.g., -BF3K, -B(OH)2). The in situ generated radical species are shown to be competent substrates in reactions with oxygen-based radicals, dichalcogenides, and N-heterocycles, yielding the corresponding substituted carboranes containing B-O, B-S, B-Se, B-Te, and B-C bonds. Remarkably, this chemistry tolerates various electronic environments, providing access to facile substitution chemistry at both electron-rich and electron-poor B-H vertices in carboranes.",2
Scalable Synthesis of InAs Quantum Dots Mediated through Indium Redox Chemistry.,"Next-generation optoelectronic applications centered in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength regimes require high-quality materials. Among these materials, colloidal InAs quantum dots (QDs) stand out as an infrared-active candidate material for biological imaging, lighting, and sensing applications. Despite significant development of their optical properties, the synthesis of InAs QDs still routinely relies on hazardous, commercially unavailable precursors. Herein, we describe a straightforward single hot injection procedure revolving around In(I)Cl as the key precursor. Acting as a simultaneous reducing agent and In source, In(I)Cl smoothly reacts with a tris(amino)arsenic precursor to yield colloidal InAs quantitatively and at gram scale. Tuning the reaction temperature produces InAs cores with a first excitonic absorption feature in the range of 700-1400 nm. A dynamic disproportionation equilibrium between In(I), In metal, and In(III) opens up additional flexibility in precursor selection. CdSe shell growth on the produced cores enhances their optical properties, furnishing particles with center emission wavelengths between 1000 and 1500 nm and narrow photoluminescence full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of about 120 meV throughout. The simplicity, scalability, and tunability of the disclosed precursor platform are anticipated to inspire further research on In-based colloidal QDs.",2
Electron-Phonon Coupling in Current-Driven Single-Molecule Junctions.,"Vibrational excitations provoked by coupling effects during charge transport through single molecules are intrinsic energy dissipation phenomena, in close analogy to electron-phonon coupling in solids. One fundamental challenge in molecular electronics is the quantitative determination of charge-vibrational (electron-phonon) coupling for single-molecule junctions. The ability to record electron-phonon coupling phenomena at the single-molecule level is a key prerequisite to fully rationalize and optimize charge-transport efficiencies for specific molecular configurations and currents. Here we exemplarily determine the pertaining coupling characteristics for a current-carrying chemically well-defined molecule by synchronous vibrational and current-voltage spectroscopy. These metal-molecule-metal junction insights are complemented by time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to assess the intramolecular vibrational relaxation dynamics. By measuring and analyzing the steady-state vibrational distribution during transient charge transport in a bis-phenylethynyl-anthracene derivative using anti-Stokes Raman scattering, we find approximately 0.5 vibrational excitations per elementary charge passing through the metal-molecule-metal junction, by means of a rate model ansatz and quantum-chemical calculations.",2
A Macrocyclic Ruthenium Carbene for Size-Selective Alkene Metathesis.,The synthesis of a macrocyclic Ru carbene catalyst for selective cross alkene metathesis is reported. The new catalyst showed different reactivity for various type 1 alkenes in homodimerization which correlated with the aggregrate size of the allylic substituent. The altered reactivity profile allowed for selective product formation in competition cross alkene metathesis between two different type 1 alkenes and tert-butyl acrylate. Selectivity in these reactions is attributed to the ability of the macrocyclic catalyst to differentiate alkenes based on their size. Two preparative examples of cross metathesis with the macrocyclic catalyst are also provided.,2
Thermodynamic Evidence of Structural Transformations in CO2-Loaded Metal-Organic Framework Zn(MeIm)2 from Heat Capacity Measurements.,"Metal-organic frameworks are a class of porous compounds with potential applications in molecular sieving, gas sequestration, and catalysis. One family of MOFs, zeolitic imidizolate frameworks (ZIFs), is of particular interest for carbon dioxide sequestration. We have previously reported the heat capacity of the sodalite topology of the zinc 2-methylimidazolate framework (ZIF-8), and in this Article we present the first low-temperature heat capacity measurements of ZIF-8 with various amounts of sorbed CO2. Molar heat capacities from 1.8 to 300 K are presented for samples containing up to 0.99 mol of CO2 per mol of ZIF-8. Samples with at least 0.56 mol of CO2 per mol of ZIF-8 display a large, broad anomaly from 70 to 220 K with a shoulder on the low-temperature side, suggesting sorption-induced structural transitions. We attribute the broad anomaly partially to a gate-opening transition, with the remainder resulting from CO2 rearrangement and/or lattice expansion. The measurements also reveal a subtle anomaly from 0 to 70 K in all samples that does not exist in the sorbate-free material, which likely reflects new vibrational modes resulting from sorbate/ZIF-8 interactions. These results provide the first thermodynamic evidence of structural transitions induced by CO2 sorption in the ZIF-8 framework.",2
Spin-Controlled Charge-Recombination Pathways across the Inorganic/Organic Interface.,"Charge transfer and recombination across the inorganic/organic interface in nanocrystal or quantum dot (QD)-molecule hybrid materials have been extensively studied. Principles of controlling charge transfer and recombination via energetics and electronic coupling have been established. However, the use of electron spin to control transfer and recombination pathways in such systems remains relatively underexplored. Here we use CdS QD-alizarin (AZ) as a model system to demonstrate this principle. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we found that the charge-separated states (QD(-)-AZ(+)) created by selectively exciting AZ molecules mostly recombined to regenerate ground-state complexes, whereas apparently the ""same"" charge separated states created by exciting QDs recombined to produce AZ molecular triplet states. Such a difference can be traced to the distinct spin configurations between excited QDs (QD*, with an ill-defined spin) and AZ ((1)AZ*, spin singlet) and the asymmetric electron and hole spin-flip rates in II-VI group QDs. The transferability of such a principle was confirmed by similar observations obtained for CdS QD-tetracene complexes. Opening an avenue for controlling charge transfer and recombination pathways via electron spin is potentially important for applications such as artificial photosynthesis.",2
Charge Transport in Sequence-Defined Conjugated Oligomers.,"A major challenge in synthetic polymers lies in understanding how primary monomer sequence affects materials properties. In this work, we show that charge transport in single molecule junctions of conjugated oligomers critically depends on the primary sequence of monomers. A series of sequence-defined oligomers ranging from two to seven units was synthesized by an iterative approach based on the van Leusen reaction, providing conjugated oligomers with backbones consisting of para-linked phenylenes connected to oxazole, imidazole, or nitro-substituted pyrrole. The charge transport properties of these materials were characterized using a scanning tunneling microscope-break junction (STM-BJ) technique, thereby enabling direct measurement of molecular conductance for sequence-defined dimers, trimers, pentamers, and a heptamer. Our results show that oligomers with specific monomer sequences exhibit unexpected and distinct charge transport pathways that enhance molecular conductance more than 10-fold. A systematic analysis using monomer substitution patterns established that sequence-defined pentamers containing imidazole or pyrrole groups in specific locations provide molecular attachment points on the backbone to the gold electrodes, thereby giving rise to multiple conductance pathways. These findings reveal the subtle but important role of molecular structure including steric hindrance and directionality of heterocycles in determining charge transport in these molecular junctions. This work brings new understanding for designing molecular electronic components.",2
Weak Bonds in a Biomimetic Adhesive Enhance Toughness and Performance.,"Developing future high performance adhesives is predicated upon achieving properties including strength and ductility. However, designing tough materials that are simultaneously strong and soft is usually contradictory in nature. Biological materials including shells and wood achieve impressive toughness by using weak bonds to connect larger structures at several length scales. Here, we show that this toughness design approach can be applied to synthetic adhesives. A biomimetic adhesive polymer, poly(catechol-acrylic acid), was examined in conjunction with several compounds containing two organic functional groups. In a typical example, the diol ethylene glycol decreased the overall system modulus. Performance was seen to increase significantly. Spectroscopic and physical methods indicated that these bifunctional additives created an interpolymeric network of weak hydrogen bonds. Material toughness was enhanced when breakable bonds were available to dissipate mechanical stresses while leaving the surrounding matrix intact. These discoveries illustrate how a biological materials strategy of interplay between strength and ductility can be achieved with sacrificial bonds in an adhesive. Such an approach may be a general principle applicable to designing higher performance electronics, transportation, and aerospace systems.",2
Efficient Separation of Nucleic Acids with Different Secondary Structures by Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"We report the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the selective separation of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) with different secondary structures through size, shape, length, and capability of conformational transition. Three MOFs with precisely controlled pore environments, Co-IRMOF-74-II, -III, and -IV, composed of Co(2+) and organic linkers (II, III, and IV), respectively, were used for the inclusion of nucleic acid into their pores from the solution. This was proven to be a spontaneous process from disordered free state to restricted ordered state via circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Three critical factors were identified for their inclusion: (1) size selection induced by steric hindrance, (2) conformation transition energy selection induced by stability, and (3) molecular weight selection. These selection rules were used to extract nucleic acids with flexible and unstable secondary structures from complex mixtures of multiple nucleic acids, leaving those with rigid and stable secondary structures in the mother liquor. This provides the possibility to separate and enrich nucleic acids in bulk through their different structure feature, which is highly desirable in genome-wide structural measurement of nucleic acids. Unlike methods that rely on specific binding antibodies or ligand, this MOF method is capable of selecting all kinds of nucleic acids with similar secondary structure features; therefore, it is suitable for the handling of a large variety and quantity of nucleic acids at the same time. This method also has the potential to gather information about the folding stability of biomolecules with secondary structures.",2
Phase Transitions in Metal-Organic Frameworks Directly Monitored through In Situ Variable Temperature Liquid-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy and In Situ X-ray Diffraction.,"Zr6-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tetratopic organic linkers have been extensively investigated owing to their versatile structural tunability. While diverse topologies and polymorphism in the resulting MOFs are often encountered with tetratopic linkers and Zr6 nodes, reports on phase transitions within these systems are rare. Thus, we have a limited understanding of polymorph transformations, hindering the rational development of pure phase materials. In this study, a phase transition from a microporous MOF, scu-NU-906, to a mesoporous MOF, csq-NU-1008, was discovered and monitored through in situ variable temperature liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (VT-LCTEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and in situ variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD). It was found that the microporous- to-mesoporous transformation in the presence of formic acid occurs via a concomitant dissolution-reprecipitation process.",2
Low-Noise Nanopore Enables In-Situ and Label-Free Tracking of a Trigger-Induced DNA Molecular Machine at the Single-Molecular Level.,"Solid-state nanopores have shown special high potential in a label-free molecular assay, structure identification, and target-index at the single-molecular level, even though frustrating electrical baseline noise is still one of the major factors that limit the spatial resolution and signaling reliability of solid-state nanopores, especially in small target detection. Here we develop a significant and easy-operating noise-reduction approach via mixing organic solvents with high dielectric constants into a traditional aqueous electrolyte. The strategy is generally effective for pores made of different materials, such as the most commonly used conical glass (CGN) or SiNx. While the mechanism should be multisourced, MD simulations suggest the noise reduction may partially arise from the even ionic distribution caused by the addition of higher dielectric species. Among all solvents experimentally tested, the two with the highest dielectric constants, formamide and methylformamide, exhibit the best noise reduction effect for target detection of CGN. The power spectral density at the low-frequency limit is reduced by nearly 3 orders with the addition of 20% formamide. Our work qualifies the reliability of solid-state nanopores into much subtler scales of detection, such as dsDNAs under 100 bp. As a practical example, bare CGN is innovatively employed to perform in-situ tracking of trigger-responsive DNA machine forming oligomers.",2
Metformin-Induced Stromal Depletion to Enhance the Penetration of Gemcitabine-Loaded Magnetic Nanoparticles for Pancreatic Cancer Targeted Therapy.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, as one of the most aggressive cancers, is characterized by rich desmoplastic stroma that forms a physical barrier for anticancer drugs. To address this issue, we herein report a two-step sequential delivery strategy for targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine (GEM). In this sequential strategy, metformin (MET) was first administrated to disrupt the dense stroma, based on the fact that MET downregulated the expression of fibrogenic cytokine TGF-beta to suppress the activity of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), through the 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. In consequence, the PSC-mediated desmoplastic reactions generating alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen were inhibited, which promoted the delivery of GEM and pH (low) insertion peptide (pHLIP) comodified magnetic nanoparticles (denoted as GEM-MNP-pHLIP). In addition, pHLIP largely increased the binding affinity of the nanodrug to PANC-1 cells. The targeted delivery and effective accumulation of MET/GEM-MNP-pHLIP in vivo were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging enhanced by the underlying magnetic nanoparticles. The tumor growth inhibition of the sequential MET and GEM-MNP-pHLIP treatment were investigated on both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor mice models. A remarkably improved therapeutic efficacy, for example, up to 91.2% growth inhibition ratio over 30 d of treatment, well-exemplified the novel cascade treatment for pancreatic cancer and the innovative use of MET.",2
Simultaneous Quantification of Vesicle Size and Catecholamine Content by Resistive Pulses in Nanopores and Vesicle Impact Electrochemical Cytometry.,"We have developed the means to simultaneously measure the physical size and count catecholamine molecules in individual nanometer transmitter vesicles. This is done by combining resistive pulse (RP) measurements in a nanopore pipet and vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC) at an electrode as the vesicle exits the nanopore. Analysis of freshly isolated bovine adrenal vesicles shows that the size and internal catecholamine concentration of vesicles varies with the occurrence of a dense core inside the vesicles. These results might benefit the understanding about the vesicles maturation, especially involving the ""sorting by retention"" process and concentration increase of intravesicular catecholamine. The methodology is applicable to understanding soft nanoparticle collisions on electrodes, vesicles in exocytosis and phagocytosis, intracellular vesicle transport, and analysis of electroactive drugs in exosomes.",2
Spectroscopic Signatures of Resonance Inhibition Reveal Differences in Donor-Bridge and Bridge-Acceptor Couplings.,"The torsional dependence of the ground state magnetic exchange coupling (J) and the corresponding electronic coupling matrix element (HDA) for eight transition metal complexes possessing donor-acceptor (D-A) biradical ligands is presented. These biradical ligands are composed of an S = 1/2 metal semiquinone (SQ) donor and an S = 1/2 nitronylnitroxide (NN) acceptor, which are coupled to each other via para-phenylene, methyl-substituted para-phenylenes, or a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane ring. The observed trends in electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectral features are in accord with a reduction in electronic and magnetic coupling between D and A units within the framework of our valence bond configuration interaction model. Moreover, our spectroscopic results highlight different orbital mechanisms that modulate coupling in these complexes, which is not manifest in the ferromagnetic JSQ-B-NN values. The work provides new detailed insight into the effects of torsional rotations which contribute to inhomogeneities in experimentally determined exchange couplings, electron transfer rates, and electron transport conductance measurements.",2
"Chromium(III)-Catalyzed C(sp(2))-H Alkynylation, Allylation, and Naphthalenation of Secondary Amides with Trimethylaluminum as Base.","Among base metals used for C-H activation reactions, chromium(III) is rather unexplored despite its natural abundance and low toxicity. We report herein chromium(III)-catalyzed C(sp(2))-H functionalization of an ortho-position of aromatic and alpha,beta-unsaturated secondary amides using readily available AlMe3 as a base and using bromoalkynes, allyl bromide, and 1,4-dihydro-1,4-epoxynaphthalene as electrophiles. This redox-neutral reaction taking place at 70-90 degrees C, requires as low as 1-2 mol % of CrCl3 or Cr(acac)3 as a catalyst without any added ligand, and tolerates functional groups such as aryl iodide, boronate, and thiophene groups. Stoichiometric and kinetics studies as well as kinetic isotope effects suggest that the catalytic cycle consists of a series of thermally stable but reactive intermediates bearing two molecules of the amide substrate on one chromium atom and also that one of these chromate(III) complexes takes part in the alkynylation, allylation, and naphthalenation reactions. The proposed mechanism accounts for the effective suppression of methyl group delivery from AlMe3 for ortho-C-H methylation.",2
Tackling the Activity and Selectivity Challenges of Electrocatalysts toward the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction via Atomically Dispersed Biatom Catalysts.,"Developing efficient catalysts for nitrogen fixation is becoming increasingly important but is still challenging due to the lack of robust design criteria for tackling the activity and selectivity problems, especially for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Herein, by means of large-scale density functional theory (DFT) computations, we reported a descriptor-based design principle to explore the large composition space of two-dimensional (2D) biatom catalysts (BACs), namely, metal dimers supported on 2D expanded phthalocyanine (M2-Pc or MM'-Pc), toward the NRR at the acid conditions. We sampled both homonuclear (M2-Pc) and heteronuclear (MM'-Pc) BACs and constructed the activity map of BACs by using N2H* adsorption energy as the activity descriptor, which reduces the number of promising catalyst candidates from over 900 to less than 100. This strategy allowed us to readily identify 3 homonuclear and 28 heteronuclear BACs, which could break the metal-based activity benchmark toward the efficient NRR. Particularly, using the free energy difference of H* and N2H* as a selectivity descriptor, we screened out five systems, including Ti2-Pc, V2-Pc, TiV-Pc, VCr-Pc, and VTa-Pc, which exhibit a strong capability of suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with favorable limiting potential of -0.75, -0.39, -0.74, -0.85, and -0.47 V, respectively. This work not only broadens the possibility of discovering more efficient BACs toward N2 fixation but also provides a feasible strategy for rational design of NRR electrocatalysts and helps pave the way to fast screening and design of efficient BACs for the NRR and other electrochemical reactions.",2
"4'-Fluorinated RNA: Synthesis, Structure, and Applications as a Sensitive (19)F NMR Probe of RNA Structure and Function.","Fluorinated RNA molecules, particularly 2'-F RNA, have found a wide range of applications in RNA therapeutics, RNA aptamers, and ribozymes and as (19)F NMR probes for elucidating RNA structure. Owing to the instability of 4'-F ribonucleosides, synthesis of 4'-F-modified RNA has long been a challenge. In this study, we developed a strategy for synthesizing a 4'-F-uridine ((4'F)U) phosphoramidite, and we used it to prepare 4'-F RNA successfully. In the context of an RNA strand, (4'F)U, which existed in a North conformation, was reasonably stable and resembled unmodified uridine well. The (19)F NMR signal of (4'F)U was sensitive to RNA secondary structure, with a chemical shift dispersion as large as 4 ppm (compared with <1 ppm for (2'F)U), which makes it a valuable probe for discriminating single-stranded RNA and A-type, B-type, and mismatched duplexes. In addition, we demonstrated that because RNA-processing enzymes treated (4'F)U the same as unmodified uridine, (4'F)U could be used to monitor RNA structural dynamics and enzyme-mediated RNA processing. Taken together, our results indicate that 4'-F RNA represents a probe with wide utility for elucidation of RNA structure and function by means of (19)F NMR spectroscopy.",2
Isolated Indium Hydrides in CHA Zeolites: Speciation and Catalysis for Nonoxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane.,"The study of the formation, characterization, and functionality of isolated surface hydrides on solid materials is a formidable task because of the complexity of solid surfaces and the difficulty of analyzing structures in solids. Herein, we found the formation of indium (In) hydride species supported by CHA zeolites. The In hydrides were formed by treatment of an In-exchanged CHA zeolite (In-CHA) with H2 at high temperatures (>773 K). In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that an [InH2](+) ion on a framework anionic site is a plausible structure. In-CHA exhibited high selectivity and durable catalytic activity for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane for at least 90 h. Kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies as well as transition state (TS) calculations suggested that [InH2](+) ions serve as catalytically active sites for selective dehydrogenation using In-CHA.",2
Unveiling Catalytic Sites in a Typical Hydrogen Photogeneration System Consisting of Semiconductor Quantum Dots and 3d-Metal Ions.,"Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in conjunction with non-noble 3d-metal ions (e.g., Fe(3+), Co(2+), and Ni(2+)) have emerged as an extremely efficient, facile, and cost-effective means of solar-driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. However, the exact structural change of the active sites under realistic conditions remains elusive, and the mechanism of H2 evolution behind the remarkable activity is poorly understood. Here, we successfully track the structural variation of the catalytic sites in the typical H2 photogeneration system consisting of CdSe/CdS QDs and 3d-metal ions (i.e., Ni(2+) used here). That is, the nickel precursor of Ni(OAc)2 changes to Ni(H2O)6(2+) in neutral H2O and eventually transforms to Ni(OH)2 nanosheets in alkaline media. Furthermore, the in operando spectroscopic techniques of electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the photoinduced transformation of Ni(OH)2 to a defective structure [Nix(0)/Ni1-x(OH)2], which acts as the real catalytic species of H2 photogeneration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further indicate that the surface Ni-vacancies (VNi) on the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets enhance the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules to enhance the local proton concentration, while the Ni(0) clusters behave as H2-evolution sites, thereby synergistically promoting the activity of H2 photogeneration in alkaline media.",2
"Isolation of a 1-Magnesium-2,3-disilacyclopropene and a Related Bis(disilenide).","Herein we report the first synthesis of a 1-magnesium-2,3-disilacyclopropene and a related bis(disilenide). Reduction of (boryl)tribromosilane (1, boryl = (HCArN)2B, Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) with magnesium in THF afforded boryl-substituted magnesium complex [(boryl)Si]2Mg(THF)3 (2) in good yield, whereas reduction of (boryl)trichlorosilane (3) with KC8 in THF led to the isolation of bridged alkoxy alkyl bis(disilenide) (THF)K(boryl)Si horizontal lineSi(boryl)O(CH2)4(boryl)Si horizontal lineSi(boryl)K(THF) (4) via ring opening of a THF molecule. X-ray diffraction analysis of 2 confirmed the presence of the novel Si2Mg three-membered ring as well as the Si horizontal lineSi double bond, which existed in a noticeably twisted B-Si-Si-B array. Complex 2 also represents the first reported example of a stable disilyne dianion.",2
Disparity of Cytochrome Utilization in Anodic and Cathodic Extracellular Electron Transfer Pathways of Geobacter sulfurreducens Biofilms.,"Extracellular electron transfer (EET) in microorganisms is prevalent in nature and has been utilized in functional bioelectrochemical systems. EET of Geobacter sulfurreducens has been extensively studied and has been revealed to be facilitated through c-type cytochromes, which mediate charge between the electrode and G. sulfurreducens in anodic mode. However, the EET pathway of cathodic conversion of fumarate to succinate is still under debate. Here, we apply a variety of analytical methods, including electrochemistry, UV-vis absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, and electron microscopy, to understand the involvement of cytochromes and other possible electron-mediating species in the switching between anodic and cathodic reaction modes. By switching the applied bias for a G. sulfurreducens biofilm coupled to investigating the quantity and function of cytochromes, as well as the emergence of Fe-containing particles on the cell membrane, we provide evidence of a diminished role of cytochromes in cathodic EET. This work sheds light on the mechanisms of G. sulfurreducens biofilm growth and suggests the possible existence of a nonheme, iron-involving EET process in cathodic mode.",2
Re-programming Hydrogel Properties Using a Fuel-Driven Reaction Cycle.,"Nature uses catalysis as an indispensable tool to control assembly and reaction cycles in vital non-equilibrium supramolecular processes. For instance, enzymatic methionine oxidation regulates actin (dis-)assembly, and catalytic guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis is found in tubulin (dis-)assembly. Here we present a completely artificial reaction cycle which is driven by a chemical fuel that is catalytically obtained from a ""pre-fuel"". The reaction cycle controls the dis-assembly and re-assembly of a hydrogel, where the rate of pre-fuel turnover dictates the morphology as well as the mechanical properties. By addition of additional fresh aliquots of fuel and removal of waste, the hydrogels can be re-programmed time after time. Overall, we show how catalytic fuel generation can control reaction/assembly kinetics and materials' properties in life-like non-equilibrium systems.",2
A Dinuclear Ruthenium(II) Complex Excited by Near-Infrared Light through Two-Photon Absorption Induces Phototoxicity Deep within Hypoxic Regions of Melanoma Cancer Spheroids.,"The dinuclear photo-oxidizing Ru(II) complex [{Ru(TAP2)}2(tpphz)](4+) (TAP = 1,4,5,8- tetraazaphenanthrene, tpphz = tetrapyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c:3'',2''-h:2''',3'''-j]phenazine), 1(4+), is readily taken up by live cells localizing in mitochondria and nuclei. In this study, the two-photon absorption cross section of 1(4+) is quantified and its use as a two-photon absorbing phototherapeutic is reported. It was confirmed that the complex is readily photoexcited using near-infrared, NIR, and light through two-photon absorption, TPA. In 2-D cell cultures, irradiation with NIR light at low power results in precisely focused phototoxicity effects in which human melanoma cells were killed after 5 min of light exposure. Similar experiments were then carried out in human cancer spheroids that provide a realistic tumor model for the development of therapeutics and phototherapeutics. Using the characteristic emission of the complex as a probe, its uptake into 280 mum spheroids was investigated and confirmed that the spheroid takes up the complex. Notably TPA excitation results in more intense luminescence being observed throughout the depth of the spheroids, although emission intensity still drops off toward the necrotic core. As 1(4+) can directly photo-oxidize DNA without the mediation of singlet oxygen or other reactive oxygen species, phototoxicity within the deeper, hypoxic layers of the spheroids was also investigated. To quantify the penetration of these phototoxic effects, 1(4+) was photoexcited through TPA at a power of 60 mW, which was progressively focused in 10 mum steps throughout the entire z-axis of individual spheroids. These experiments revealed that, in irradiated spheroids treated with 1(4+), acute and rapid photoinduced cell death was observed throughout their depth, including the hypoxic region.",2
Two Distinct Mechanisms of Inhibition of LpxA Acyltransferase Essential for Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis.,"The lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway is considered an attractive drug target against the rising threat of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report two novel small-molecule inhibitors (compounds 1 and 2) of the acyltransferase LpxA, the first enzyme in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway. We show genetically that the antibacterial activities of the compounds against efflux-deficient Escherichia coli are mediated by LpxA inhibition. Consistently, the compounds inhibited the LpxA enzymatic reaction in vitro. Intriguingly, using biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization, we reveal two distinct mechanisms of LpxA inhibition; compound 1 is a substrate-competitive inhibitor targeting apo LpxA, and compound 2 is an uncompetitive inhibitor targeting the LpxA/product complex. Compound 2 exhibited more favorable biological and physicochemical properties than compound 1 and was optimized using structural information to achieve improved antibacterial activity against wild-type E. coli. These results show that LpxA is a promising antibacterial target and imply the advantages of targeting enzyme/product complexes in drug discovery.",2
Selectivity-Determining Steps in O2 Reduction Catalyzed by Iron(tetramesitylporphyrin).,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the cathode reaction in fuel cells and its selectivity for water over hydrogen peroxide production is important for these technologies. Iron porphyrin catalysts have long been studied for the ORR, but the origins of their selectivity are not well understood because the selectivity-determining step(s) usually occur after the rate-determining step. We report here the effects of acid concentration, as well as other solution conditions such as acid pKa, on the H2O2/H2O selectivity in electrocatalytic ORR by iron(tetramesitylporphyrin) (Fe(TMP)) in DMF. The results show that selectivity reflects a kinetic competition in which the dependence on [HX] is one order greater for the production of H2O than H2O2. Based on such experimental results and computational studies, we propose that the selectivity is governed by competition between protonation of the hydroperoxo intermediate, Fe(III)(TMP)(OOH), to produce water versus dissociation of the HOO(-) ligand to yield H2O2. The data rule out a bifurcation based on the regioselectivity of protonation of the hydroperoxide, as suggested in the enzymatic systems. Furthermore, the analysis developed in this report should be generally valuable to the study of selectivity in other multi-proton/multi-electron electrocatalytic reactions.",2
"Cobalt-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of alpha,beta-Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids by Homolytic H2 Cleavage.","The asymmetric hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acids using readily prepared bis(phosphine) cobalt(0) 1,5-cyclooctadiene precatalysts is described. Di-, tri-, and tetra-substituted acrylic acid derivatives with various substitution patterns as well as dehydro-alpha-amino acid derivatives were hydrogenated with high yields and enantioselectivities, affording chiral carboxylic acids including Naproxen, (S)-Flurbiprofen, and a d-DOPA precursor. Turnover numbers of up to 200 were routinely obtained. Compatibility with common organic functional groups was observed with the reduced cobalt(0) precatalysts, and protic solvents such as methanol and isopropanol were identified as optimal. A series of bis(phosphine) cobalt(II) bis(pivalate) complexes, which bear structural similarity to state-of-the-art ruthenium(II) catalysts, were synthesized, characterized, and proved catalytically competent. X-band EPR experiments revealed bis(phosphine)cobalt(II) bis(carboxylate)s were generated in catalytic reactions and were identified as catalyst resting states. Isolation and characterization of a cobalt(II)-substrate complex from a stoichiometric reaction suggests that alkene insertion into the cobalt hydride occurred in the presence of free carboxylic acid, producing the same alkane enantiomer as that from the catalytic reaction. Deuterium labeling studies established homolytic H2 (or D2) activation by Co(0) and cis addition of H2 (or D2) across alkene double bonds, reminiscent of rhodium(I) catalysts but distinct from ruthenium(II) and nickel(II) carboxylates that operate by heterolytic H2 cleavage pathways.",2
Coupling of Nitric Oxide and Release of Nitrous Oxide from Rare-Earth-Dinitrosyliron Complexes.,"Addition of Lewis acidic [Cp*2M](+) (M = Y, Gd) to the dinitrosyliron complexes (DNICs) [(NacNac(Ar))Fe(NO)2](-) (Ar = mesityl, 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) results in formation of the isonitrosyl-bridged DNICs [(Cp*)2M(mu-ON)2Fe(NacNac(Ar))]. When Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, coupling of the NO ligands and release of N2O occur. Two factors contribute to this previously unobserved DNIC reactivity mode. First, the oxophilic rare-earth elements drive the formation of isonitrosyl bonds, forcing the DNIC nitrogen atoms into proximity. Second, the bulky substituents further squeeze the DNIC, which ultimately overcomes the barrier to NO coupling, demonstrating that N2O elimination can occur from a single iron center.",2
Key Structural Motifs Balance Metal Binding and Oxidative Reactivity in a Heterobimetallic Mn/Fe Protein.,"Heterobimetallic Mn/Fe proteins represent a new cofactor paradigm in bioinorganic chemistry and pose countless outstanding questions. The assembly of the active site defies common chemical convention by contradicting the Irving-Williams series, while the scope of reactivity remains unexplored. In this work, the assembly and C-H bond activation process in the Mn/Fe R2-like ligand-binding oxidase (R2lox) protein is investigated using a suite of biophysical techniques, including time-resolved optical spectroscopy, global kinetic modeling, X-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, protein electrochemistry, and mass spectrometry. Selective metal binding is found to be under thermodynamic control, with the binding sites within the apo-protein exhibiting greater Mn(II) affinity than Fe(II) affinity. The comprehensive analysis of structure and reactivity of wild-type R2lox and targeted primary and secondary sphere mutants indicate that the efficiency of C-H bond activation directly correlates with the Mn/Fe cofactor reduction potentials and is inversely related to divalent metal binding affinity. These findings suggest the R2lox active site is precisely tuned for achieving both selective heterobimetallic binding and high levels of reactivity and offer a mechanism to examine the means by which proteins achieve appropriate metal incorporation.",2
Alkylamine-Substituted Perthiocarbamates: Dual Precursors to Hydropersulfide and Carbonyl Sulfide with Cardioprotective Actions.,"The recent discovery of hydropersulfides (RSSH) in mammalian systems suggests their potential roles in cell signaling. However, the exploration of RSSH biological significance is challenging due to their instability under physiological conditions. Herein, we report the preparation, RSSH-releasing properties, and cytoprotective nature of alkylamine-substituted perthiocarbamates. Triggered by a base-sensitive, self-immolative moiety, these precursors show efficient RSSH release and also demonstrate the ability to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the presence of thiols. Using this dually reactive alkylamine-substituted perthiocarbamate platform, the generation of both RSSH and COS is tunable with respect to half-life, pH, and availability of thiols. Importantly, these precursors exhibit cytoprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide-mediated toxicity in H9c2 cells and cardioprotective effects against myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury, indicating their potential application as new RSSH- and/or COS-releasing therapeutics.",2
Macrocyclic Modalities Combining Peptide Epitopes and Natural Product Fragments.,"""Hot loop"" protein segments have variable structure and conformation and contribute crucially to protein-protein interactions. We describe a new hot loop mimicking modality, termed PepNats, in which natural product (NP)-inspired structures are incorporated as conformation-determining and -restricting structural elements into macrocyclic hot loop-derived peptides. Macrocyclic PepNats representing hot loops of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and human agouti-related protein (AGRP) were synthesized on solid support employing macrocyclization by imine formation and subsequent stereoselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition as key steps. PepNats derived from the iNOS DINNN hot loop and the AGRP RFF hot spot sequence yielded novel and potent ligands of the SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 2 (SPSB2) that binds to iNOS, and selective ligands for AGRP-binding melanocortin (MC) receptors. NP-inspired fragment absolute configuration determines the conformation of the peptide part responsible for binding. These results demonstrate that combination of NP-inspired scaffolds with peptidic epitopes enables identification of novel hot loop mimics with conformationally constrained and biologically relevant structure.",2
Continuous Variation of Lattice Dimensions and Pore Sizes in Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"The continuous variation of the lattice metric in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) allows precise control over their chemical and physical properties. This has been realized herein by a series of mixed-linker and Zr6-cluster-based MOFs, namely, continuously variable MOFs (CVMOFs). Similar to the substitutional solid solutions, organic linkers with different lengths and various ratios were homogeneously incorporated into a framework rather than being allowed to form separate phases or domains, which was manifested by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, fluorescence quenching experiments, and molecular simulations. The unit cell dimension, surface area, and pore size of CVMOFs were precisely controlled by adopting different linker sets and linker ratios. We demonstrate that CVMOFs allow the continuous and fine tailoring of cell-edge lengths from 17.83 to 32.63 A, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas from 585 to 3791 m(2)g(-1), and pore sizes up to 15.9 A. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy can be applied to other MOF systems with various metal nodes thus allowing for a variety of CVMOFs with unprecedented tunability.",2
Carbocatalytic Acetylene Cyclotrimerization: A Key Role of Unpaired Electron Delocalization.,"Development of sustainable catalysts for synthetic transformations is one of the most challenging and demanding goals. The high prices of precious metals and the unavoidable leaching of toxic metal species leading to environmental contamination make the transition metal-free catalytic systems especially important. Here we demonstrate that carbene active centers localized on carbon atoms at the zigzag edge of graphene represent an alternative platform for efficient catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation in the synthesis of benzene. The studied acetylene trimerization reaction is an efficient atom-economic route to build an aromatic ring-a step ubiquitously important in organic synthesis and industrial applications. Computational modeling of the reaction mechanism reveals a principal role of the reversible spin density oscillations that govern the overall catalytic cycle, facilitate the product formation, and regenerate the catalytically active centers. Dynamic pi-electron interactions in 2D carbon systems open new opportunities in the field of carbocatalysis, unachievable by means of transition metal-catalyzed transformations. The theoretical findings are confirmed experimentally by generating key moieties of the carbon catalyst and performing the acetylene conversion to benzene.",2
Predictive Multivariate Models for Bioorthogonal Inverse-Electron Demand Diels-Alder Reactions.,"Inverse-electron demand Diels-Alder cycloadditions have emerged as important bioorthogonal reactions in chemical biology. Understanding and predicting reaction rates for bioconjugation reactions is fundamental for evaluating their efficacy in biological systems. Here, we present multivariate models to predict the second order rate constants of bioorthogonal inverse-electron demand Diels-Alder reactions involving 1,2,4,5-tetrazines derivatives. A data-driven approach was used to model these reactions by parametrizing both the dienophiles and the dienes partners. The models are statistically robust and were used to predict/extrapolate the outcome of several reactions as well as to identify mechanistic differences among similar reactants.",2
Correlation between the C-C Cross-Coupling Activity and C-to-Ni Charge Transfer Transition of High-Valent Ni Complexes.,"High-valent Ni complexes have proven to be good platforms for diverse cross-coupling reactions that are otherwise difficult to be achieved with conventional low-valent catalysts. However, their reductive elimination (RE) activities are still significantly variable by up to 5 orders of magnitude, depending on the supporting ligand and oxidation state of the Ni center. To elucidate frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) that determine the RE activity of the Ni center, the electronic structures of cycloneophyl (CH2C(CH3)2-o-C6H4) Ni(III) and Ni(IV) complexes have been characterized by utilizing various transition metal-based spectroscopic techniques such as electronic absorption, magnetic circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, resonance Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. In combination with density functional theory computations, the spectroscopic analyses have shown that the energies of the C-to-Ni charge-transfer (CT) electronic transitions are strongly correlated to the rates of C-C bond-forming RE reaction. This correlation suggests that the kinetic barrier of the RE reaction is determined by energy cost for internal CT (ICT) from the coordinated carbon moiety to the Ni center, and that FMOs involved in the RE reaction and the C-to-Ni CT electronic transitions are essentially identical. This FMO determination has led us to discover that photoexcitation to the C-to-Ni CT excited states accelerates the C-C cross-coupling reaction by up to 10(5) times, as the CT electronic transition can substitute for the rate-determining ICT step of the RE reaction at the ground electronic state.",2
Catalytic Acceptorless Dehydrogenation of Aliphatic Alcohols.,"We developed the first acceptorless dehydrogenation of aliphatic secondary alcohols to ketones under visible light irradiation at room temperature by devising a ternary hybrid catalyst system comprising a photoredox catalyst, a thiophosphate organocatalyst, and a nickel catalyst. The reaction proceeded through three main steps: hydrogen atom transfer from the alpha-C-H bond of an alcohol substrate to the thiyl radical of the photo-oxidized organocatalyst, interception of the generated carbon-centered radical with a nickel catalyst, and beta-hydride elimination. The reaction proceeded in high yield under mild conditions without producing side products (except H2 gas) from various alcohols, including sterically hindered alcohols, a steroid, and a pharmaceutical derivative. This catalyst system also promoted acceptorless cross-dehydrogenative esterification from aldehydes and alcohols through hemiacetal intermediates.",2
Ultrathin Two-Dimensional Membranes Assembled by Ionic Covalent Organic Nanosheets with Reduced Apertures for Gas Separation.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a promising category of porous materials possessing extensive chemical tunability, high porosity, ordered arrangements at a molecular level, and considerable chemical stability. Despite these advantages, the application of COFs as membrane materials for gas separation is limited by their relatively large pore apertures (typically >0.5 nm), which exceed the sieving requirements for most gases whose kinetic diameters are less than 0.4 nm. Herein, we report the fabrication of ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) membranes through layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of two kinds of ionic covalent organic nanosheets (iCONs) with different pore sizes and opposite charges. Because of the staggered packing of iCONs with strong electrostatic interactions, the resultant membranes exhibit features of reduced aperture size, optimized stacking pattern, and compact dense structure without sacrificing thickness control, which are suitable for molecular sieving gas separation. One of the hybrid membranes, TpEBr@TpPa-SO3Na with a thickness of 41 nm, shows a H2 permeance of 2566 gas permeation units (GPUs) and a H2/CO2 separation factor of 22.6 at 423 K, surpassing the recent Robeson upper bound along with long-term hydrothermal stability. This strategy provides not only a high-performance H2 separation membrane candidate but also an inspiration for pore engineering of COF or 2D porous polymer membranes.",2
Polymer Interfacial Self-Assembly Guided Two-Dimensional Engineering of Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets.,"Two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanosheets with micro- and/or mesopores have attracted great attention due to unique physical and chemical properties, but well-defined nanoporous carbon nanosheets with tunable thickness and pore size have been rarely realized. Here, we develop a polymer-polymer interfacial self-assembly strategy to achieve hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (HNCNSs) by integrating the migration behaviors of immiscible ternary polymers with block copolymer (BCP)-directed self-assembly. The balanced interfacial compatibility of BCP allows the migration of a BCP-rich phase to the interface between two immiscible homopolymer major phases (i.e., homopoly(methyl methacrylate) and homopolystyrene), where the BCP-rich phase spreads thinly to a thickness of a few nanometers to decrease the interfacial tension. BCP-directed coassembly with organic-inorganic precursors constructs an ordered mesostructure. Carbonization and chemical etching yield ultrathin HNCNSs with hierarchical micropores and mesopores. This approach enables facile control over the thickness (5.6-75 nm) and mesopore size (25-46 nm). As an anode material in a potassium ion battery, HNCNSs show high specific capacity (178 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1)) with excellent long-term stability (2000 cycles), by exploiting the advantages of the hierarchical pores and 2D nanosheet morphology (efficient ion/electron diffusion) and of the large interlayer spacing (stable ion insertion).",2
Correlating Mechanical Sensitivity with Spin Transition in the Explosive Spin Crossover Complex [Fe(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2n.,"Spin crossover complexes are known to undergo bond length, volume, and enthalpy changes during spin transition. In an explosive spin crossover complex, these changes could affect the mechanical and initiation sensitivity of the explosive and lead to the development of a new class of sensitivity switchable materials. To explore this relationship, the well-known spin crossover compound [Fe(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2n (1) was re-evaluated for its explosive properties, and its mechanical impact sensitivity was correlated to spin transition. A variable temperature impact test was developed and used to evaluate the impact sensitivity of 1 in the low spin (LS, S = 0), thermally accessed high spin (HS, S = 2), and mixed LS and HS states. For comparison, the structurally similar Ni compound, [Ni(Htrz)3]n[ClO4]2n (2), which does not undergo a spin transition at accessible temperatures, was synthesized and characterized, and its explosive properties and variable temperature impact sensitivity measured. These results reveal a correlation between impact sensitivity and spin transition, where 1 exhibits lower impact sensitivity in the LS state and increases in sensitivity upon transition to the HS state. Density functional theory was used to predict structural changes that occur upon spin transition that correlate to the change in sensitivity. This demonstrates, for the first time, an explosive spin crossover compound (ExSCO) that exhibits switchable impact sensitivity with a fully reversible internal switching mechanism.",2
Cooperative and Competitive Occlusion of Organic and Inorganic Structure-Directing Agents within Chabazite Zeolites Influences Their Aluminum Arrangement.,"We combine experiment and theory to investigate the cooperation or competition between organic and inorganic structure-directing agents (SDAs) for occupancy within microporous voids of chabazite (CHA) zeolites and to rationalize the effects of SDA siting on biasing the framework Al arrangement (Al-O(-Si-O)x-Al, x = 1-3) among CHA zeolites of essentially fixed composition (Si/Al = 15). CHA zeolites crystallized using mixtures of TMAda(+) and Na(+) contain one TMAda(+) occluded per cage and Na(+) co-occluded in an amount linearly proportional to the number of 6-MR paired Al sites, quantified by Co(2+) titration. In contrast, CHA zeolites crystallized using mixtures of TMAda(+) and K(+) provide evidence that three K(+) cations, on average, displace one TMAda(+) from occupying a cage and contain predominantly 6-MR isolated Al sites. Moreover, CHA crystallizes from synthesis media containing more than 10-fold higher inorganic-to-organic ratios with K(+) than with Na(+) before competing crystalline phases form, providing a route to decrease the amount of organic SDA needed to crystallize high-silica CHA. Density functional theory calculations show that differences in the ionic radii of Na(+) and K(+) determine their preferences for siting in different CHA rings, which influences their energy to co-occlude with TMAda(+) and stabilize different Al configurations. Monte Carlo models confirm that energy differences resulting from Na(+) or K(+) co-occlusion promote the formation of 6-MR and 8-MR paired Al arrangements, respectively. These results highlight opportunities to exploit using mixtures of organic and inorganic SDAs during zeolite crystallization in order to more efficiently use organic SDAs and influence framework Al arrangements.",2
Rational Design of Mechanism-Based Inhibitors and Activity-Based Probes for the Identification of Retaining alpha-l-Arabinofuranosidases.,"Identifying and characterizing the enzymes responsible for an observed activity within a complex eukaryotic catabolic system remains one of the most significant challenges in the study of biomass-degrading systems. The debranching of both complex hemicellulosic and pectinaceous polysaccharides requires the production of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases among a wide variety of coexpressed carbohydrate-active enzymes. To selectively detect and identify alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases produced by fungi grown on complex biomass, potential covalent inhibitors and probes which mimic alpha-l-arabinofuranosides were sought. The conformational free energy landscapes of free alpha-l-arabinofuranose and several rationally designed covalent alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase inhibitors were analyzed. A synthetic route to these inhibitors was subsequently developed based on a key Wittig-Still rearrangement. Through a combination of kinetic measurements, intact mass spectrometry, and structural experiments, the designed inhibitors were shown to efficiently label the catalytic nucleophiles of retaining GH51 and GH54 alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases. Activity-based probes elaborated from an inhibitor with an aziridine warhead were applied to the identification and characterization of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases within the secretome of A. niger grown on arabinan. This method was extended to the detection and identification of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases produced by eight biomass-degrading basidiomycete fungi grown on complex biomass. The broad applicability of the cyclophellitol-derived activity-based probes and inhibitors presented here make them a valuable new tool in the characterization of complex eukaryotic carbohydrate-degrading systems and in the high-throughput discovery of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases.",2
Engineering Intrinsic Flexibility in Polycrystalline Molecular Semiconductor Films by Grain Boundary Plasticization.,"Mechanically flexible films of the highly crystalline core-cyanated perylenediimide (PDIF-CN2) molecular semiconductor are achieved via a novel grain boundary plasticization strategy in which a specially designed polymeric binder (PB) is used to connect crystallites at the grain boundaries. The new PB has a naphthalenediimide-dithiophene pi-conjugated backbone end-functionalized with PDI units. In contrast to conventional polymer-small molecule blends where distinct phase separation occurs, this blend film with plasticized grain boundaries exhibits a morphology typical of homogeneous PDIF-CN2 films which is preserved upon bending at radii as small as 2 mm. Thin-film transistors fabricated with PB/PDIF-CN2 blends exhibit substantial electron mobilities even after repeated bending. This design represents a new approach to realizing flexible and textured semiconducting pi-electron films with good mechanical and charge transport properties.",2
Observation of Vortex Domains in a Two-Dimensional Lead Iodide Perovskite Ferroelectric.,"Topological defects, such as vortices and skyrmions, provide a wealth of splendid possibilities for new nanoscale devices because of their marvelous electronic, magnetic, and mechanical behaviors. Recently, great advances have been made in the study of the ferroelectric vortex in conventional perovskite oxides, such as BaTiO3 and BiFeO3. Despite extensive interest, however, no intriguing ferroelectric vortex structures have yet been found in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), which are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, ease of fabrication, and low acoustical impedance. We observed the robust vortex-antivortex topological configurations in a two-dimensional (2D) layered OIHP ferroelectric (4,4-DFPD)2PbI4 (4,4-DFPD is 4,4-difluoropiperidinium). This provides future directions for the study of perovskites and makes it a promising alternative for nanoscale ferroelectric devices in medical, micromechanical, and biomechanical applications.",2
Chemoselective Catalytic alpha-Oxidation of Carboxylic Acids: Iron/Alkali Metal Cooperative Redox Active Catalysis.,"We developed a chemoselective catalytic activation of carboxylic acid for a 1e(-) radical process. alpha-Oxidation of a variety of carboxylic acids, which preferentially undergo undesired decarboxylation under radical conditions, proceeded efficiently under the optimized conditions. Chemoselective enolization of carboxylic acid was also achieved even in the presence of more acidic carbonyls. Extensive mechanistic studies revealed that the cooperative actions of iron species and alkali metal ions derived from 4 A molecular sieves substantially facilitated the enolization. For the first time, catalytic enolization of unprotected carboxylic acid was achieved without external addition of stoichiometric amounts of Bronsted base. The formed redox-active heterobimetallic enediolate efficiently coupled with free radical TEMPO, providing synthetically useful alpha-hydroxy and keto acid derivatives.",2
Twist Building Blocks from Planar to Tetrahedral for the Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Rational construction of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with novel structures still remains a challenge. Herein, we report the designed synthesis of two COFs, 2D-BPTA-COF and 3D-BMTA-COF, starting from biphenyl-based precursors but with different groups at the ortho positions. Both COFs exhibited high crystallinity and large surface area, and interestingly, 2D-BPTA-COF crystallizes into 2D sheets with AB stacking mode while 3D-BMTA-COF adopts a 7-fold interpenetrated structure with pts topology. This structural difference could be ascribed to the introduction of methyl groups in the building blocks, as the dihedral angle of biphenyl rings in 2D-BPTA-COF is approximately 0 degrees while in 3D-BMTA-COF it is approximately 60 degrees . Therefore, it is possible to synthesize COFs with different structures by twisting building blocks from planar to tetrahedral with steric hindrance. We believe this result represents a general and straightforward way to expand the diversity of tetrahedral nodes for constructing 3D COFs in the future, and moreover, a new tetrahedral node for constructing 3D COFs is now available.",2
Slow Propagation of Ice Binding Limits the Ice-Recrystallization Inhibition Efficiency of PVA and Other Flexible Polymers.,"Ice recrystallization inhibitors (IRI) are of critical importance in biology, cryopreservation of cells and organs, and frozen foods. Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are the most potent IRI. Their cost and cytotoxicity drive the design of synthetic flexible polymers that mimic their function. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is the most potent biomimetic found to date, although it is orders of magnitude less potent than AFGPs. A lack of molecular understanding of the factors that limit the IRI efficiency of PVA and other flexible ice-binding polymers hinders the design of more potent IRI. Here, we use molecular and numerical simulations to elucidate how the degree of polymerization (DP) and functionalization of PVA impact its IRI. Our simulations indicate that the onset of IRI activity of PVA occurs for 15 < DP < 20, in agreement with experiments. We predict that polymers with stronger binding to ice per monomer attain IRI activity at lower DP and identify this as a contributor to the higher IRI potency of AFGPs. The simulations reveal that the limiting step for binding of flexible molecules to ice is not the alignment of the molecule to the surface or the initiation of the binding but the propagation to reach its full binding potential. This distinguishes AFGPs and PVA from rigid antifreeze proteins and, we argue, is responsible for their different scaling of efficiencies with molecular size. We use the analysis of PVA to identify the factors that control the IRI activity of flexible polymers and assess the molecular characteristics that endow AFGPs with their exceptional IRI potency.",2
Three-Dimensional Mesoporous Covalent Organic Frameworks through Steric Hindrance Engineering.,"The development of three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with large pores and high surface areas is of great importance for various applications. However, it remains a major challenge due to the frequent structural interpenetration and pore collapse after the removal of guest species situated in the pores. Herein, we report for the first time a series of 3D mesoporous COFs through a general method of steric hindrance engineering. By placing methoxy and methyl groups strategically on the monomers, we can obtain non-interpenetrated 3D COFs of diamondoid structures with permanent mesopores (up to 26.5 A) and high surface areas (>3000 m(2) g(-1)), which are far superior to those of reported conventional COFs with the same topology. This work thus opens a new avenue to create 3D large-pore COFs for potential applications in adsorption and separation of large inorganic, organic, and biological molecules.",2
Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) via Regioselective C-C Bond Activation of Biphenylenes.,"Chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are expected to have unusual physical properties due to their chirality and expanded pi-conjugated system. Indeed, PAHs are promising compounds as chiral recognizers and organic semiconductors. Therefore, an efficient method for the synthesis of chiral PAHs is strongly desired. In contrast to helically chiral PAHs, there are only limited examples of the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral PAHs. Herein, we report the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of benzo[b]fluoranthene-based axially chiral PAHs in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to >99%, >99% ee) by regioselective cleavage of the sterically hindered C-C bond of biphenylenes. The consecutive cyclizations could provide polycyclic PAHs with two chiral axes. The obtained chiral PAHs have high epsilon values (up to epsilon = 8.9 x 10(4)), quantum yields (up to Phi = 0.67), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) property (|glum| = up to 3.5 x 10(-3)).",2
Titanium Alkoxide-Based Regioselective Alkyne-Alkyne Reductive Coupling Mediated by In Situ Generated Arylamidate.,"Titanium alkoxide-based alkyne-alkyne reductive coupling mediated by in situ generated arylamidate is described. A high level of regioselectivity is achieved in 37 examples, where (E,E)-dienes are exclusively formed. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first example of an apparent amide and carbamate directing effect in metal-mediated reductive coupling.",2
Design and Remarkable Efficiency of the Robust Sandwich Cluster Composite Nanocatalysts ZIF-8@Au25@ZIF-67.,"Heterogeneous catalysts with precise surface and interface structures are of great interest to decipher the structure-property relationships and maintain remarkable stability while achieving high activity. Here, we report the design and fabrication of the new sandwich composites ZIF-8@Au25@ZIF-67[tkn] and ZIF-8@Au25@ZIF-8[tkn] [tkn = thickness of shell] by coordination-assisted self-assembly with well-defined structures and interfaces. The composites ZIF-8@Au25@ZIF-67 efficiently catalyzed both 4-nitrophenol reduction and terminal alkyne carboxylation with CO2 under ambient conditions with remarkably improved activity and stability, compared to the simple components Au25/ZIF-8 and Au25@ZIF-8, highlighting the highly useful function of the ultrathin shell. In addition, the performances of these composite sandwich catalysts are conveniently regulated by the shell thickness. This concept and achievements should open a new avenue to the targeted design of well-defined nanocatalysts with enhanced activities and stabilities for challenging reactions.",2
Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins through Coengineering of Proteins and Polymeric Delivery Vehicles.,"Nanocarrier-mediated protein delivery is a promising strategy for fundamental research and therapeutic applications. However, the efficacy of the current platforms for delivery into cells is limited by endosomal entrapment of delivered protein cargo with concomitantly inefficient access to the cytosol and other organelles, including the nucleus. We report here a robust, versatile polymeric-protein nanocomposite (PPNC) platform capable of efficient (>/=90%) delivery of proteins to the cytosol. We synthesized a library of guanidinium-functionalized poly(oxanorborneneimide) (PONI) homopolymers with varying molecular weights to stabilize and deliver engineered proteins featuring terminal oligoglutamate ""E-tags"". The polymers were screened for cytosolic delivery efficiency using imaging flow cytometry with cytosolic delivery validated using confocal microscopy and activity of the delivered proteins demonstrated through functional assays. These studies indicate that the PPNC platform provides highly effective and tunable cytosolic delivery over a wide range of formulations, making them robust agents for therapeutic protein delivery.",2
Chiral 2D Organic Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite with Circular Dichroism Tunable Over Wide Wavelength Range.,"The effect of chemical-composition modification on the chiroptical property of chiral organic ammonium cation-containing organic inorganic hybrid perovskite (chiral OIHP) is investigated. Varying the mixing ratio of bromide and iodide anions in S- or R-C6H5CH2(CH3)NH3)2PbI4(1-x)Br4x modifies the band gap of chiral OIHP, leading to a shift of the circular dichroism (CD) signal from 495 to 474 nm. However, it is also found that an abrupt crystalline structure transition occurs, and the CD signal is turned off when iodide-determinant phases are transformed into the bromide-determinant phase. To obtain CD in the wavelength range where the bromide-determinant phase is supposed to exhibit chiroptical activity, that is, <474 nm, S- or R-C12H7CH2(CH3)NH3 with a larger spacer group can be adopted; thus, the CD signal can be further blue-shifted to approximately 375 nm. Here, we show that chemical-composition modification of chiral OIHP affects the chiroptical properties of chiral OIHP in two ways: (1) tuning the wavelength of CD by modulating the excitonic band structure and (2) switching the CD on and off by inducing a crystalline-structure change. These properties can be utilized for structural engineering of high-performance chiroptical materials for spin-polarized light-emitting devices and polarization-based optoelectronics.",2
Fluidic Multivalent Membrane Nanointerface Enables Synergetic Enrichment of Circulating Tumor Cells with High Efficiency and Viability.,"The ubiquitous biomembrane interface, with its dynamic lateral fluidity, allows membrane-bound components to rearrange and localize for high-affinity multivalent ligand-receptor interactions in diverse life activities. Inspired by this, we herein engineered a fluidic multivalent nanointerface by decorating a microfluidic chip with aptamer-functionalized leukocyte membrane nanovesicles for high-performance isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This fluidic biomimetic nanointerface with active recruitment-binding afforded significant affinity enhancement by 4 orders of magnitude, exhibiting 7-fold higher capture efficiency compared to a monovalent aptamer functionalized-chip in blood. Meanwhile, this soft nanointerface inherited the biological benefits of a natural biomembrane, minimizing background blood cell adsorption and maintaining excellent CTC viability (97.6%). Using the chip, CTCs were successfully detected in all cancer patient samples tested (17/17), suggesting the high potential of this fluidity-enhanced multivalent binding strategy in clinical applications. We expect this bioengineered interface strategy will lead to the design of innovative biomimetic platforms in the biomedical field by leveraging natural cell-cell interaction with a natural biomaterial.",2
"Heterostructural CsPbX3-PbS (X = Cl, Br, I) Quantum Dots with Tunable Vis-NIR Dual Emission.","Perovskite and chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) are important nano semiconductors. It has been a challenge to synthesize heterostructural QDs combining perovskite and chalcogenide with tailorable photoelectronic properties. In this report, heterostructural CsPbX3-PbS (X = Cl, Br, I) QDs were successfully synthesized via a room temperature in situ transformation route. The CsPbX3-PbS QDs show a tunable dual emission feature with the visible and near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) corresponding to CsPbX3 and PbS, respectively. Typically, the formation and evolution of the heterostructural CsPbBr3-PbS QDs with reaction time was investigated. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was applied to illuminate the exciton dynamics in CsPbBr3-PbS QDs. The mild synthetic method and TAS proved perovskite to PbS energy transfer may pave the way toward highly efficient QD photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.",2
Hydroxide Based Integrated CO2 Capture from Air and Conversion to Methanol.,"The first example of an alkali hydroxide-based system for CO2 capture and conversion to methanol has been established. Bicarbonate and formate salts were hydrogenated to methanol with high yields in a solution of ethylene glycol. In an integrated one-pot system, CO2 was efficiently captured by an ethylene glycol solution of the base and subsequently hydrogenated to CH3OH at relatively mild temperatures (100-140 degrees C) using Ru-PNP catalysts. The produced methanol can be easily separated by distillation. Hydroxide base regeneration at low temperatures was observed for the first time. Finally, CO2 capture from ambient air and hydrogenation to CH3OH was demonstrated. We postulate that the high capture efficiency and stability of hydroxide bases make them superior to existing amine-based routes for direct air capture and conversion to methanol in a scalable process.",2
Structural Relaxation Enabled by Internal Vacancy Available in a 24-Atom Gold Cluster Reinforces Catalytic Reactivity.,"Unveiling the mystery of the contribution of nonsurface or noninterface sites in a catalyst to its catalytic performance remains a great challenge because of the difficulty in capturing precisely structural information (surface plus inner) encoded in the catalyst. This work attempts to elucidate the critical role of the internal vacancy in an atomically precise 24-atom gold cluster in regulating the catalytic performance on the hydrogenation reaction of CO2. The experiment results show that the Au24 cluster with internal vacancy can mitigate sintering and exhibit high catalytic activity under relatively harsh reaction conditions, in contrast to the structurally similar Au25 cluster without internal vacancy. Our computational study suggests that the internal vacancy in Au24 provides the cluster with much more structural flexibility, which may be crucial to resisting the aggregation of the cluster and further postponing the deactivation. The hydrogenation and coupling stages of the reaction intermediates are proposed to explain the potential reaction pathway of CO2 with H2 on the Au24 catalyst with internal vacancy.",2
Substrate and Stereochemical Control of Peptidoglycan Cross-Linking by Transpeptidation by Escherichia coli PBP1B.,"Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) catalyzing transpeptidation reactions that stabilize the peptidoglycan component of the bacterial cell wall are the targets of beta-lactams, the most clinically successful antibiotics to date. However, PBP-transpeptidation enzymology has evaded detailed analysis, because of the historical unavailability of kinetically competent assays with physiologically relevant substrates and the previously unappreciated contribution of protein cofactors to PBP activity. By re-engineering peptidoglycan synthesis, we have constructed a continuous spectrophotometric assay for transpeptidation of native or near native peptidoglycan precursors and fragments by Escherichia coli PBP1B, allowing us to (a) identify recognition elements of transpeptidase substrates, (b) reveal a novel mechanism of stereochemical editing within peptidoglycan transpeptidation, (c) assess the impact of peptidoglycan substrates on beta-lactam targeting of transpeptidation, and (d) demonstrate that both substrates have to be bound before transpeptidation occurs. The results allow characterization of high molecular weight PBPs as enzymes and not merely the targets of beta-lactam acylation.",2
Stable Organic Diradicals Based on Fused Quinoidal Oligothiophene Imides with High Electrical Conductivity.,"Unpaired electrons of organic radicals can offer high electrical conductivity without doping, but they typically suffer from low stability. Herein, we report two organic diradicaloids based on quinoidal oligothiophene derivative (QOT), that is, BTICN and QTICN, with high stability and conductivity by employing imide-bridged fused molecular frameworks. The attachment of a strong electron-withdrawing imide group to the tetracyano-capped QOT backbones enables extremely deeply aligned LUMO levels (from -4.58 to -4.69 eV), cross-conjugated diradical characters, and remarkable ambient stabilities of the diradicaloids with half-lives > 60 days, which are among the highest for QOT diradicals and also the widely explored polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-based diradicals. Specifically, QTICN based on a tetrathiophene imide exhibits a cross-conjugation assisted self-doping in the film state as revealed by XPS and Raman studies. This property in combination with its ordered packing yields a high electrical conductivity of 0.34 S cm(-1) for the QTICN films with substantial ambient stability, which is also among the highest values in organic radical-based undoped conductive materials reported to date. When used as an n-type thermoelectric material, QTICN shows a promising power factor of 1.52 uW m(-1) K(-2). Our results not only provide new insights into the electron conduction mechanism of the self-doped QOT diradicaloids but also demonstrate the great potential of fused quinoidal oligothiophene imides in developing stable diradicals and high-performance doping-free n-type conductive materials.",2
Photocontrolled Radical Polymerization from Hydridic C-H Bonds.,"Given the ubiquity of carbon-hydrogen bonds in biomolecules and polymer backbones, the development of a photocontrolled polymerization selectively grafting from a C-H bond represents a powerful strategy for polymer conjugation. This approach would circumvent the need for complex synthetic pathways currently used to introduce functionality at a polymer chain end. On this basis, we developed a hydrogen-atom abstraction strategy that allows for a controlled polymerization selectively from a hydridic C-H bond using a benzophenone photocatalyst, a trithiocarbonate-derived disulfide, and visible light. We performed the polymerization from a variety of ethers, alkanes, unactivated C-H bonds, and alcohols. Our method lends itself to photocontrol which has important implications for building advanced macromolecular architectures. Finally, we demonstrate that we can graft polymer chains controllably from poly(ethylene glycol) showcasing the potential application of this method for controlled grafting from C-H bonds of commodity polymers.",2
In Situ Deactivation of Catechol-Containing Adhesive Using Electrochemistry.,"Marine mussels secret catechol-containing adhesive proteins that enable these organisms to bind to various surfaces underwater. Synthetic mimics of these proteins have been created to function as adhesives and coatings for a wide range of applications. Here, we demonstrated the use of in situ electrical field stimulation to deactivate the adhesive property of catechol-containing adhesive that is in direct contact with a surface. Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) contact mechanics test was performed using a titanium (Ti) sphere in the presence of a pH 7.5 aqueous buffer. The Ti sphere also served as a conductive electrode for applying electricity to the adhesive, while a platinum (Pt) wire served as the counter electrode. Work of adhesion (Wadh) decreased with increased levels of applied voltage and current, exposure time to the applied electricity, and salt concentration of the interfacial buffer. Application of 9 V for 1 min completely deactivated the adhesive. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and tracking of catechol oxidation byproduct, hydrogen peroxide, confirmed that catechol was oxidized as a result of applied electricity. Contact mechanics testing further confirmed that the Young's modulus of the adhesive increased by nearly 4 folds at the interface as a result of oxidative cross-linking, even though the modulus of the bulk of the adhesive was unaffected by applied electricity. The accumulation of hydroxyl ions near the cathode increased the local solution pH, which promoted oxidation-induced cross-linking of catechol and subsequently decreased its adhesive property. Tuning adhesive properties through in situ electrochemical oxidation provides on-demand control over the adhesive, which will potentially add another dimension in designing synthetic mimics of mussel adhesive proteins.",2
Second Coordination Sphere Effects in an Evolved Ru Complex Based on Highly Adaptable Ligand Results in Rapid Water Oxidation Catalysis.,"A new Ru complex containing the deprotonated 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine-6,6''-diphosphonic acid (H4tPa) and pyridine (py) of general formula [Ru(II)(H3tPa-kappa-N(3)O)(py)2](+), 2(+), has been prepared and thoroughly characterized by means of spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, X-ray diffraction analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Complex 2(+) presents a dynamic behavior in the solution that involves the synchronous coordination and the decoordination of the dangling phosphonic groups of the tPa(4-) ligand. However, at oxidation state IV, complex 2(+) becomes seven coordinated with the two phosphonic groups now bonded to the metal center. Further, at this oxidation state at neutral and basic pH, the Ru complex undergoes the coordination of an exogenous OH(-) group from the solvent that leads to an intramolecular aromatic O atom insertion into the CH bond of one of the pyridyl groups, forming the corresponding phenoxo-phosphonate Ru complex [Ru(III)(tPaO-kappa-N(2)OPOC)(py)2](2-), 4(2-), where tPaO(5-) is the 3-(hydroxo-[2,2':6',2''-terpyridine]-6,6''-diyl)bis(phosphonate) ligand. This new in situ generated Ru complex, 4(2-), has been isolated and spectroscopically and electrochemically characterized. In addition, a crystal structure has been also obtained using single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Complex 4(2-) turns out to be an exceptional water oxidation catalyst achieving record maximum turnover frequencies (TOFmax) on the order of 16000 s(-1). A mechanistic analysis complemented with DFT calculations has also been carried out, showing the critical role of intramolecular second coordination sphere effects exerted by the phosphonate groups in lowering the activation energy at the rate-determining step.",2
Oxygen Stabilizes Photoluminescence of CdSe/CdS Core/Shell Quantum Dots via Deionization.,"By taking advantage of well-defined spectroscopic signatures of high-quality CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs, the effects of oxygen on photoluminescence (PL) of QDs were studied systematically and quantitatively at both single-dot and ensemble (on substrate and in solution) levels, which reveals a unified yet simple picture. With a sufficient amount of oxygen in the system during photoexcitation, the core/shell QDs in all forms would be deionized timely from the photogenerated and inefficient trion state back to the efficient single-exciton state, with superoxide radicals as the reduction product of oxygen. Under a given excitation power, rates of both spontaneous deionization and photodeionization channels increased by increasing the oxygen pressure, but photoionization of the QDs was barely affected by the oxygen pressure. While stabilizing PL by oxygen was identified for both CdSe plain core and CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs, irreversible photocorrosion was only observed for CdSe plain core QDs, suggesting the importance of high-quality epitaxial shells for QDs in various applications.",2
Optical Supramolecular Sensing of Creatinine.,"Calix[4]pyrrole phosphonate-cavitands were used as receptors for the design of supramolecular sensors for creatinine and its lipophilic derivative hexylcreatinine. The sensing principle is based on indicator displacement assays of an inherently fluorescent guest dye or a black-hole quencher from the receptor's cavity by means of competition with the creatinine analytes. The systems were thermodynamically and kinetically characterized regarding their 1:1 binding properties by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H and (31)P NMR), isothermal titration calorimetry, and optical spectroscopies (UV/vis absorption and fluorescence). For the use of the black-hole indicator dye, the calix[4]pyrrole was modified with a dansyl chromophore as a signaling unit that engages in Forster resonance energy transfer with the indicator dye. The 1:1 binding constants of the indicator dyes are in the range of 10(7) M(-1), while hexylcreatinine showed values around (2-4) x 10(5) M(-1). The competitive displacement of the indicators by hexylcreatinine produced supramolecular fluorescence turn-on sensors that work at micromolar analyte concentrations that are compatible with those observed for healthy as well as sick patients. The limit of detection for one of the systems reached submicromolar ranges (110 nM).",2
Highly Luminescent Copper Iodide Cluster Based Inks with Photoluminescence Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 98.,"Highly luminescent inks are desirable for various applications such as decorative coating, art painting, and anticounterfeiting, to name a few. However, present inks display low photoluminescent efficiency requiring a strong excitation light to make them glow. Here, we report a highly luminescent ink based on the copper-iodide/1-Propyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium (Cu4I6(pr-ted)2) hybrid cluster with a quantum efficiency exceeding 98%. Under the interaction between the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 hybrid cluster and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), the highly luminescent Cu4I6(pr-ted)2/PVP ink can be facilely prepared via the one-pot solution synthesis. The obtained ink exhibits strong green light emission that originates from the efficient phosphorescence of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanocrystals. Attractively, the ink displays high conversion efficiency for the ultraviolet light to bright green light emission due to its wide Stokes shift, implying great potential for anticounterfeiting and luminescent solar concentrator coating.",2
Blending Ionic and Coordinate Bonds in Hybrid Semiconductor Materials: A General Approach toward Robust and Solution-Processable Covalent/Coordinate Network Structures.,"Inorganic semiconductor materials are best known for their superior physical properties, as well as their structural rigidity and stability. However, the poor solubility and solution-processability of these covalently bonded network structures has long been a serious drawback that limits their use in many important applications. Here, we present a unique and general approach to synthesize robust, solution-processable, and highly luminescent hybrid materials built on periodic and infinite inorganic modules. Structure analysis confirms that all compounds are composed of one-dimensional anionic chains of copper iodide (CumIm+2(2-)) coordinated to cationic organic ligands via Cu-N bonds. The choice of ligands plays an important role in the coordination mode (mu(1)-MC or mu(2)-DC) and Cu-N bond strength. Greatly suppressed nonradiative decay is achieved for the mu(2)-DC structures. Record high quantum yields of 85% (lambdaex = 360 nm) and 76% (lambdaex = 450 nm) are obtained for an orange-emitting 1D-Cu4I6(L6). Temperature dependent PL measurements suggest that both phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence contribute to the emission of these 1D-AIO compounds, and that the extent of nonradiative decay of the mu(2)-DC structures is much less than that of the mu(1)-DC structures. More significantly, all compounds are remarkably soluble in polar aprotic solvents, distinctly different from previously reported CuI based hybrid materials made of charge-neutral CumXm (X = Cl, Br, I), which are totally insoluble in all common solvents. The greatly enhanced solubility is a result of incorporation of ionic bonds into extended covalent/coordinate network structures, making it possible to fabricate large scale thin films by solution processes.",2
A Convolutional Neural Network-Based Approach for the Rapid Annotation of Molecularly Diverse Natural Products.,"This report describes the first application of the novel NMR-based machine learning tool ""Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology"" (SMART 2.0) for mixture analysis and subsequent accelerated discovery and characterization of new natural products. The concept was applied to the extract of a filamentous marine cyanobacterium known to be a prolific producer of cytotoxic natural products. This environmental Symploca extract was roughly fractionated, and then prioritized and guided by cancer cell cytotoxicity, NMR-based SMART 2.0, and MS(2)-based molecular networking. This led to the isolation and rapid identification of a new chimeric swinholide-like macrolide, symplocolide A, as well as the annotation of swinholide A, samholides A-I, and several new derivatives. The planar structure of symplocolide A was confirmed to be a structural hybrid between swinholide A and luminaolide B by 1D/2D NMR and LC-MS(2) analysis. A second example applies SMART 2.0 to the characterization of structurally novel cyclic peptides, and compares this approach to the recently appearing ""atomic sort"" method. This study exemplifies the revolutionary potential of combined traditional and deep learning-assisted analytical approaches to overcome longstanding challenges in natural products drug discovery.",2
Oxidation of Nonactivated Anilines to Generate N-Aryl Nitrenoids.,"A low-temperature, protecting-group-free oxidation of 2-substituted anilines has been developed to generate an electrophilic N-aryl nitrenoid intermediate that can engage in C-NAr bond formation to construct functionalized N-heterocycles. The exposure of 2-substituted anilines to PIFA and trifluoroacetic acid or 10 mol % Sc(OTf)3 triggers nitrenoid formation, followed by productive and selective C-NAr and C-C bond formation to yield spirocyclic- or bicyclic 3H-indoles or benzazepinones. Our experiments demonstrate the breadth of these oxidative processes, uncover underlying fundamental elements that control selectivity, and demonstrate how the distinct reactivity patterns embedded in N-aryl nitrenoid reactive intermediates can enable access to functionalized 3H-indoles or benzazepinones.",2
"Multicomponent Pyrazole Synthesis from Alkynes, Nitriles, and Titanium Imido Complexes via Oxidatively Induced N-N Bond Coupling.","Pyrazoles are an important class of heterocycles found in a wide range of bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals. Pyrazole synthesis often requires hydrazine or related reagents where an intact N-N bond is conservatively installed into a pyrazole precursor fragment. Herein, we report the multicomponent oxidative coupling of alkynes, nitriles, and Ti imido complexes for the synthesis of multisubstituted pyrazoles. This modular method avoids potentially hazardous reagents like hydrazine, instead forming the N-N bond in the final step via oxidation-induced coupling on Ti. The mechanism of this transformation has been studied in-depth through stoichiometric reactions of the key diazatitanacyclohexadiene intermediate, which can be accessed via multicomponent coupling of Ti imidos with nitriles and alkynes, ring opening of 2-imino-2H-azirines, or direct metalation of 4-azadiene-1-amine derivatives. The critical transformation in this reaction is the 2-electron oxidation-induced N-N coupling on Ti. This is a rare example of formal N-N coupling on a metal center, which likely occurs through an electrocyclic mechanism analogous to a Nazarov cyclization. Conveniently, these 2-electron-oxidized diazatitanacyclohexadiene intermediates can be accessed via disproportionation of the 1-electron-oxidized species, which allows utilization of weak oxidants such as TEMPO.",2
Development of Chiral Ureates as Chiral Strong Bronsted Base Catalysts.,"Recently, chiral Bronsted bases having high basicity have emerged as a powerful tool in developing new catalytic enantioselective reactions. However, such chiral strong Bronsted base catalysts are still very scarce. Herein, we report the development of a chiral anionic Bronsted base having a N,N'-dialkyl ureate moiety as a basic site. Its prominent catalytic activity was demonstrated in the enantioselective addition reactions of alpha-thioacetamides as less acidic pronucleophiles with various electrophiles. Thus, the newly developed chiral catalyst with high accessibility and structural tunability would expand the scope of viable enantioselective transformations under Bronsted base catalysis.",2
Covalent C-N Bond Formation through a Surface Catalyzed Thermal Cyclodehydrogenation.,"The integration of substitutional dopants at predetermined positions along the hexagonal lattice of graphene-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is a critical tool in the design of functional electronic materials. Here, we report the unusually mild thermally induced oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of dianthryl pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxalines to form the four covalent C-N bonds in tetraazateranthene on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. Bond-resolved scanning probe microscopy, differential conductance spectroscopy, along with first-principles calculations unambiguously confirm the structural assignment. Detailed mechanistic analysis based on ab initio density functional theory calculations reveals a stepwise mechanism featuring a rate determining barrier of only DeltaE() = 0.6 eV, consistent with the experimentally observed reaction conditions.",2
A Simple Molecular Design Strategy for Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Capable of Visible-Light-Driven Water Splitting.,"Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising metal-free materials for photocatalytic water splitting because of their high surface area and predictability to assemble various molecules with tunable electronic properties. Unfortunately, 2D COFs capable of visible-light-driven photocatalytic overall water splitting are rare, partly due to rigorous requirements to their band alignments and coexistence of catalytic sites for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, 12 2D nitrogen-linked COFs are designed based on first-principles calculations and topological assembly of molecular segments with catalytic activities toward either HER or OER, respectively. The electronic band structures calculated with HSE06 method indicate that 2D COFs are semiconductors with a widely tunable bandgap ranging from 1.92 to 3.23 eV. The positions of both conduction and valence band edges of nine 2D COFs match well with the chemical reaction potential of H2/H(+) and O2/H2O, which are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Of particular importance is that three of them based on 2,4,6-tris(4-methylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TST) can split water into hydrogen and oxygen under visible light. Our results agree with respect to the literature, with three of them having been studied for photocatalytic HER or CO2 reduction. In addition, we further experimentally demonstrate that I-TST presents both HER and OER activity under visible light. Our findings present a route to design practical 2D COFs as metal-free and single-material photocatalysts for overall water splitting under visible light.",2
Nickel-catalysed anti-Markovnikov hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with unactivated arenes facilitated by non-covalent interactions.,"Anti-Markovnikov additions to alkenes have been a longstanding goal of catalysis, and anti-Markovnikov addition of arenes to alkenes would produce alkylarenes that are distinct from those formed by acid-catalysed processes. Existing hydroarylations are either directed or occur with low reactivity and low regioselectivity for the n-alkylarene. Herein, we report the first undirected hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with unactivated arenes that occurs with high regioselectivity for the anti-Markovnikov product. The reaction occurs with a nickel catalyst ligated by a highly sterically hindered N-heterocyclic carbene. Catalytically relevant arene- and alkene-bound nickel complexes have been characterized, and the rate-limiting step was shown to be reductive elimination to form the C-C bond. Density functional theory calculations, combined with second-generation absolutely localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis, suggest that the difference in activity between catalysts containing large and small carbenes results more from stabilizing intramolecular non-covalent interactions in the secondary coordination sphere than from steric hindrance.",2
Coordination cages as permanently porous ionic liquids.,"Porous materials are widely used in industry for applications that include chemical separations and gas scrubbing. These materials are typically porous solids, although the liquid state can be easier to manipulate in industrial settings. The idea of combining the size and shape selectivity of porous domains with the fluidity of liquids is a promising one and porous liquids composed of functionalized organic cages have recently attracted attention. Here we describe an ionic-liquid, porous, tetrahedral coordination cage. Complementing the gas binding observed in other porous liquids, this material also encapsulates non-gaseous guests-shape and size selectivity was observed for a series of isomeric alcohols. Three gaseous chlorofluorocarbon guests, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane and chlorotrifluoromethane, were also shown to be taken up by the liquid coordination cage with an affinity that increased with their size. We hope that these findings will lead to the synthesis of other porous liquids whose guest-uptake properties may be tailored to fulfil specific functions.",2
Electronic complementarity permits hindered butenolide heterodimerization and discovery of novel cGAS/STING pathway antagonists.,"sp(3)-hybridized attached-rings are common motifs in secondary metabolites and represent tetrahedral equivalents to the biaryl substructures that overpopulate synthetic libraries. Few methods are available that can link fully substituted carbon atoms of two rings with stereocontrol. Here we have developed a stereoselective, heteroselective butenolide coupling that exhibits an unusually fast rate of C-C bond formation driven by exquisite complementarity of the reacting pi systems. Heterodimerization generates a compound collection with topological complexity and diverse principal moments of inertia. The special status of the sp(3)-sp(3) attached-ring motif is demonstrated in a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes pathway, which recruited these butenolide heterodimers from a field of 250,000 compounds. The driving forces underlying this general attached-ring coupling identify a novel paradigm for the accession of wider natural product chemical space, accelerating the discovery of selective lead compounds.",2
Competition between CO2 Reduction and Hydrogen Evolution on a Gold Electrode under Well-Defined Mass Transport Conditions.,"Gold is one of the most selective catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to CO. However, the concomitant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains unavoidable under aqueous conditions. In this work, a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) setup has been developed to study quantitatively the role of mass transport in the competition between these two reactions on the Au surface in 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolyte. Interestingly, while the faradaic selectivity for CO formation was found to increase with enhanced mass transport (from 67% to 83%), this effect is not due to an enhancement of the CO2RR rate. Remarkably, the inhibition of the competing HER from water reduction with increasing disk rotation rate is responsible for the enhanced CO2RR selectivity. This can be explained by the observation that, on the Au electrode, water reduction improves with more alkaline pH. As a result, the decrease in the local alkalinity near the electrode surface with enhanced mass transport suppresses HER due to the water reduction. Our study shows that controlling the local pH by mass transport conditions can tune the HER rate, in turn regulating the CO2RR and HER competition in the general operating potential window for CO2RR (-0.4 to -1 V vs RHE).",2
Boronate Ester Bullvalenes.,"Boronate ester bullvalenes are now accessible in two to four operationally simple steps. This unlocks late-stage diversification through Suzuki cross-coupling reactions to give mono-, di-, and trisubstituted bullvalenes. Moreover, a linchpin strategy enables preprogrammed installation of two different substituents. Analysis of solution phase isomer distributions and single-crystal X-ray structures reveals that isomer preference in the crystal lattice is due to general shape selectivity.",2
Investigating the Origin of Enhanced C2+ Selectivity in Oxide-/Hydroxide-Derived Copper Electrodes during CO2 Electroreduction.,"Oxide-/hydroxide-derived copper electrodes exhibit excellent selectivity toward C2+ products during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the origin of such enhanced selectivity remains controversial. Here, we prepared two Cu-based electrodes with mixed oxidation states, namely, HQ-Cu (containing Cu, Cu2O, CuO) and AN-Cu (containing Cu, Cu(OH)2). We extracted an ultrathin specimen from the electrodes using a focused ion beam to investigate the distribution and evolution of various Cu species by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We found that at the steady stage of the CO2RR, the electrodes have all been reduced to Cu(0), regardless of the initial states, suggesting that the high C2+ selectivities are not associated with specific oxidation states of Cu. We verified this conclusion by control experiments in which HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were pretreated to fully reduce oxides/hydroxides to Cu(0), and the pretreated electrodes showed even higher C2+ selectivity compared with their unpretreated counterparts. We observed that the oxide/hydroxide crystals in HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were fragmented into nanosized irregular Cu grains under the applied negative potentials. Such a fragmentation process, which is the consequence of an oxidation-reduction cycle and does not occur in electropolished Cu, not only built an intricate network of grain boundaries but also exposed a variety of high-index facets. These two features greatly facilitated the C-C coupling, thus accounting for the enhanced C2+ selectivity. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced characterization techniques enables investigating the structural and chemical states of electrodes in unprecedented detail to gain new insights into a widely studied system.",2
Electrochemical Synthesis of Biaryls via Oxidative Intramolecular Coupling of Tetra(hetero)arylborates.,"We report herein versatile, transition metal-free and additive-free (hetero)aryl-aryl coupling reactions promoted by the oxidative electrocoupling of unsymmetrical tetra(hetero)arylborates (TABs) prepared from ligand-exchange reactions on potassium trifluoroarylborates. Exploiting the power of electrochemical oxidations, this method complements the existing organoboron toolbox. We demonstrate the broad scope, scalability, and robustness of this unconventional catalyst-free transformation, leading to functionalized biaryls and ultimately furnishing drug-like small molecules, as well as late stage derivatization of natural compounds. In addition, the observed selectivity of the oxidative coupling reaction is related to the electronic structure of the TABs through quantum-chemical calculations and experimental investigations.",2
"The Quest for the Ideal Base: Rational Design of a Nickel Precatalyst Enables Mild, Homogeneous C-N Cross-Coupling.","Palladium-catalyzed amination reactions using soluble organic bases have provided a solution to the many issues associated with heterogeneous reaction conditions. Still, homogeneous C-N cross-coupling approaches cannot yet employ bases as weak and economical as trialkylamines. Furthermore, organic base-mediated methods have not been developed for Ni(0/II) catalysis, despite some advantages of such systems over those employing Pd-based catalysts. We designed a new air-stable and easily prepared Ni(II) precatalyst bearing an electron-deficient bidentate phosphine ligand that enables the cross-coupling of aryl triflates with aryl amines using triethylamine (TEA) as base. The method is tolerant of sterically congested coupling partners, as well as those bearing base- and nucleophile-sensitive functional groups. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we determined that the electron-deficient auxiliary ligands decrease both the pKa of the Ni-bound amine and the barrier to reductive elimination from the resultant Ni(II)-amido complex. Moreover, we determined that the preclusion of Lewis acid-base complexation between the Ni catalyst and the base, due to steric factors, is important for avoiding catalyst inhibition.",2
Photoinduced Proton-Transfer Polymerization: A Practical Synthetic Tool for Soft Lithography Applications.,"Proton-transfer photopolymerization through the thiol-epoxy ""click"" reaction is shown to be a versatile new method for the fabrication of micro- and nanosized polymeric patterns. In this approach, complexation of a guanidine base, diazabicycloundecene (DBU), with benzoylphenylpropionic acid (ketoprofen) generates a photolabile salt. Under illumination at a wavelength of 365 nm, the salt undergoes a photodecarboxylation reaction to release DBU as a base. The base-catalyzed ring opening reaction then creates cross-linked poly(beta-hydroxyl thio-ether) patterns. The surface chemistry of these patterns can be altered through alkylation of the thio-ether linkages. For example, a reaction with bromoacetic acid produces a hitherto unknown sulfonium/carboxylate-based zwitterionic motif that endows antibiofouling capacity to the micropatterns.",2
Correlated X-ray Ptychography and Fluorescence Nano-Tomography on the Fragmentation Behavior of an Individual Catalyst Particle during the Early Stages of Olefin Polymerization.,"A combination of X-ray ptychography and X-ray fluorescence tomography (XRF) has been used to study the fragmentation behavior of an individual Ziegler-Natta catalyst particle, approximately 40 mum in diameter, in the early stages of propylene polymerization with submicron spatial resolution. The electron density signal obtained from X-ray ptychography gives the composite phases of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst particle fragments and isotactic polypropylene, while 3-D XRF visualizes multiple isolated clusters, rich in Ti, of several microns in size. The radial distribution of Ti species throughout the polymer-catalyst composite particle shows that the continuous bisection fragmentation model is the main contributor to the fragmentation pathway of the catalyst particle as a whole. Furthermore, within the largest Ti clusters the fragmentation pathway was found to occur through both the continuous bisection and layer-by-layer models. The fragmentation behavior of polyolefin catalysts was for the first time visualized in 3-D by directly imaging and correlating the distribution of the Ti species to the polymer-catalyst composite phase.",2
Multimodal Imaging Probe Development for Pancreatic beta Cells: From Fluorescence to PET.,"Pancreatic beta cells are responsible for insulin secretion and are important for glucose regulation in a healthy body and diabetic disease patient without prelabeling of islets. While the conventional biomarkers for diabetes have been glucose and insulin concentrations in the blood, the direct determination of the pancreatic beta cell mass would provide critical information for the disease status and progression. By combining fluorination and diversity-oriented fluorescence library strategy, we have developed a multimodal pancreatic beta cell probe PiF for both fluorescence and for PET (positron emission tomography). By simple tail vein injection, PiF stains pancreatic beta cells specifically and allows intraoperative fluorescent imaging of pancreatic islets. PiF-injected pancreatic tissue even facilitated an antibody-free islet analysis within 2 h, dramatically accelerating the day-long histological procedure without any fixing and dehydration step. Not only islets in the pancreas but also the low background of PiF in the liver allowed us to monitor the intraportal transplanted islets, which is the first in vivo visualization of transplanted human islets without a prelabeling of the islets. Finally, we could replace the built-in fluorine atom in PiF with radioactive 18F and successfully demonstrate in situ PET imaging for pancreatic islets.",2
Observation of Mobius Aromatic Planar Metallaborocycles.,"Mobius aromaticity was developed for twisted annulenes with electron counting rules opposite to those of Huckel aromaticity. The introduction of transition metals makes it possible for planar cyclic systems to exhibit Mobius aromaticity. Here we report the first planar monocyclic metallaboron systems with Mobius aromaticity. The structures and bonding of two rhenium-boride clusters are studied by high-resolution photoelectron imaging and ab initio calculations. The ReB3(-) cluster is shown to have a near-pyramidal structure, while ReB4(-) is found to be a planar pentagonal ring. Chemical bonding analyses show that both ReB4(-) and ReB4 possess four delocalized pi-electrons, including two pi-electrons in an orbital of Mobius topology. NICS calculations reveal strong aromatic characters in ReB4(-) and ReB4, consistent with the 4n electron counting rule for Mobius aromaticity.",2
Ru(II)-Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Fluorides via eta(6)-Coordination.,"We developed a Ru/hemilabile-ligand-catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) of aryl fluorides as the limiting reagents. Significant ligand enhancement was demonstrated by the engagement of both electron-rich and neutral arenes in the SNAr amination without using excess arenes. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the nucleophilic substitution proceeds on a eta(6)-complex of the Ru catalyst and the substrate, and the hemilabile ligand facilitates dissociation of products from the metal center.",2
Anhydride Post-Synthetic Modification in a Hierarchical Metal-Organic Framework.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are important porous materials. Post-synthetic modification (PSM) of MOFs via the pendant groups or secondary functional groups of organic linkers has been widely used to introduce new or enhance existing properties of MOFs for various practical applications. In this work, we have constructed, for the first time, a novel platform for PSM of MOFs by introducing an anhydride functional group into a hierarchically porous MOF (MIL-121) as an effective anchor. We have demonstrated that the combination of the high reactivity of anhydride and hierarchical porosity makes this protocol particularly novel and important, as it led to excellent opportunities of incorporating not only a wide variety of organic molecules with different sizes and chemical nature but also the noble metal complexes in MOFs. Specifically, we show that the anhydride group decorated in the MOF exhibits a high reactivity toward covalently binding 10 different guest molecules including alcohols, amines, thiols, and noble metal (Pt(II)/Pt(IV)) complexes, whereas the hierarchical pores created in the MOF allow the incorporation of guest species varying in size from methanol to larger molecules such as polyaromatic amines. This novel approach provides the community with a new avenue to prepare MOF-based materials for targeted applications. To illustrate this point, we furnish an example of using this new platform to prepare a Pt-based electrocatalyst which shows excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a pivotal half-reaction in hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells and other energy storage and conversion devices.",2
Recognition of Polymer Terminus by Metal-Organic Frameworks Enabling Chromatographic Separation of Polymers.,"Unlike commonly used molecular recognition techniques, recognition of polymer structures requires an additional aspect of extremely high recognition ability, by which marginal structural differences can be identified in a large polymer chain. Herein we show that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can recognize polymer terminal structures, thus enabling the first reported chromatographic separation of polymers. End-functionalized polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are selectively inserted into the MOF channel, the insertion kinetics being dependent on the projection size of the PEG terminus. This size-selective insertion mechanism facilitates precise discrimination of end-functionalized PEGs using liquid chromatography (LC). An MOF-packed column thus provides an efficient and easily accessible method for the separation of such end-functionalized polymers using conventional LC systems.",2
Photolabile Linkers: Exploiting Labile Bond Chemistry to Control Mode and Rate of Hydrogel Degradation and Protein Release.,"Photolabile moieties have been utilized in applications ranging from peptide synthesis and controlled protein activation to tunable and dynamic materials. The photochromic properties of nitrobenzyl (NB) based linkers are readily tuned to respond to cytocompatible light doses and are widely utilized in cell culture and other biological applications. While widely utilized, little is known about how the microenvironment, particularly confined aqueous environments (e.g., hydrogels), affects both the mode and rate of cleavage of NB moieties, leading to unpredictable limitations in control over system properties (e.g., rapid hydrolysis or slow photolysis). To address these challenges, we synthesized and characterized the photolysis and hydrolysis of NB moieties containing different labile bonds (i.e., ester, amide, carbonate, or carbamate) that served as labile crosslinks within step-growth hydrogels. We observed that NB ester bond exhibited significant rates of both photolysis and hydrolysis, whereas, importantly, the NB carbamate bond had superior light responsiveness and resistance to hydrolysis within the hydrogel microenvironment. Exploiting this synergy and orthogonality of photolytic and hydrolytic degradation, we designed concentric cylinder hydrogels loaded with different cargoes (e.g., model protein with different fluorophores) for either combinatorial or sequential release, respectively. Overall, this work provides new facile chemical approaches for tuning the degradability of NB linkers and an innovative strategy for the construction of multimodal degradable hydrogels, which can be utilized to guide the design of not only tunable materials platforms but also controlled synthetic protocols or surface modification strategies.",2
Total Synthesis of (-)-Batrachotoxinin A: A Local-Desymmetrization Approach.,"An enantioselective total synthesis of (-)-batrachotoxinin A is accomplished based on a key photoredox coupling reaction and the subsequent local-desymmetrization operation. After the expedient assembly of the highly oxidized steroid skeleton, a delicate sequence of redox manipulations was carried out to deliver a late-stage intermediate on gram scale-and ultimately (-)-batrachotoxinin A in an efficient manner.",2
Supramolecular Alternating Donor-Acceptor Assembly toward Intercalated Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Conventionally, z-direction modulation of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs) is difficult to achieve because they rely on spontaneous pi-pi interactions to form 3D architectures. Herein, we report a facile construction of a novel intercalated covalent organic framework (Intercalated-COF) by synchronizing operations of supramolecular donor-acceptor (D-A) interactions (A unit: 2,5,8,11-tetra(p-formylphenyl)-perylene diimide (PDI) 1; D unit: perylene 3, as intercalator) in the vertical directions, with polymerizations (by only reacting 1 with p-phenylenediamine 2) in the lateral directions. In this Intercalated-COF, the PDI-based covalent 2D layers are uniformly separated by perylene guest layers. This supramolecular strategy opens the possibility for z-direction modulation of 2D-COFs through ""intercalating"" various guest molecules and thus may contribute to the exploration of advanced applications of these porous and crystalline frameworks.",2
Bis-Metal Complexes of Doubly N-Confused Dioxohexaphyrins as Potential Near-Infrared-II Photoacoustic Dyes.,"We investigated the detailed photophysical properties of a series of bis-metal (Zn and Cu) dioxohexaphyrin complexes as potential second near-infrared (NIR-II)-light responsive dyes. A cisoid-configured 28pi-electron-conjugated dioxohexaphyrin analogue (c-3a) containing two peculiar ""confused pyrrole"" moieties in the framework is identified as a reduced isomer derivative of a transoid 26pi-dioxohexaphyrin (t-2a). The symmetry-altered structure of c-3a affords a heteroleptic inner environment within the NNNN/NNOO donor core, which imparts its highly flexible electronic features and nonplanar geometry. The macrocycle c-3a can be transformed into the corresponding 26pi-electron congener (c-2a) having a coplanar rectangular structure by unique solvent-mediated redox reactivity. Furthermore, upon metal complexation, saddle-distorted bis-metal complexes (c-M2-2a) were formed as the 26pi-conjugated structural isomer of the trans-dioxohexaphyrin species (i.e., t-M2-2a). These isoelectronic dioxohexaphyrins demonstrate precise geometry-dependent photophysical properties. Broad tailing NIR-II absorption, weak emissive character, and rapid-decay of the S1 state are observed for c-Zn2-2a. In contrast, the coplanar t-M2-2a exhibits efficient photoacoustic response upon laser excitation with NIR-II light (lambda > 1000 nm). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an expanded porphyrin-based photoacoustic contrast agent responsive to NIR-II light.",2
"The Gigantic {Ni36Gd102} Hexagon: A Sulfate-Templated ""Star-of-David"" for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Magnetic Cooling.","Gigantic coordination molecules assembled from a large number of metal ions and organic ligands are structurally and functionally challenging to characterize. Here we show that a heterometallic cluster [Ni36Gd102(OH)132(mmt)18(dmpa)18(H2dmpa)24(CH3COO)84(SO4)18(NO3)18(H2O)30].Br6(NO 3)6.(H2O)x.(CH3OH)y, (1, x approximately 130, y approximately 60), shaped like a ""Star of David"", can be synthesized using a ""mixed-ligand"" and ""sulfate-template"" strategy. In terms of metal nuclearity number, 1 is the second largest 3d-4f cluster to date. In the solid state, 1 is porous after removing the lattice guests. The N2 adsoption experiment reveals that the BET and Langmuir surface areas are 299.8 and 412.0 cm(2) g(-1), respectively. CO2 adsorption at 298 K gives the amount of 45 cm(3) g(-1) for 1. More importantly, 1 is soluble in common organic solvents and exhibits high solution stability revealed by high resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and low-dose transmission electron microscopy. The solubility and the potential open metal sites owing to the labile coordinating components prompted us to investigate the photocatalytic properties of 1, which displays high selectivity and efficiency for reduction of CO2 to CO with turnover number and turnover frequency of 29700 and 1.2 s(-1), respectively. These values are higher than most catalysts working under the same conditions, presumably due to the strong Ni-CO2 binding effect. In addition, the large percentage of Gd(III) in 1 leads to a large magnetic entropy change (41.3 J.kg(-1).K(-1)) at 2.0 K for DeltaH = 7 T.",2
Multimachine Communication Network That Mimics the Adaptive Immune Response.,"Biological organisms capable of controlling and performing a wide variety of functions have inspired attempts to mimic biological systems with designable intelligence. Here we develop a multimachine communication network (MMCN) to mimic the operation and function of adaptive immune response (AIR) via connecting three kinds of DNA machines built from module-functionalized gold nanoparticles. These machines simulate three critical immune cells, dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes, and their differentiation and coordinated interaction upon exposure and response to an invading pathogen. MMCN is composed of standard modules with track, movement, and fuel components that allow for the (1) integration and adaptability of a single machine, (2) convenient spatiotemporal control of the sequential activation of a single machine, and (3) rapid reaction rate and high efficiency owing to an enhanced local concentration of interacting species. We show that the proposed network can sense and clear the corresponding pathogen via consecutive activation and connection of the machines, simultaneously forming a memory to respond more rapidly and effectively upon the second invasion of the pathogen. This system may be extended to construct powerful networks to execute more sophisticated tasks and accomplish diverse functions.",2
Requirements for Terpene Cyclizations inside the Supramolecular Resorcinarene Capsule: Bound Water and Its Protonation Determine the Catalytic Activity.,"The elucidation of the requirements for efficient catalysis within supramolecular host systems is an important prerequisite for developing novel supramolecular catalysts. The resorcinarene hexamer has recently been shown to be the first supramolecular catalyst to promote the tail-to-head terpene cyclization in a biomimetic fashion. We herein present the synthesis of a number of resorcinarene-based macrocycles composed of different ratios of resorcinol and pyrogallol units capable of self-assembly and compare the corresponding assemblies regarding their catalytic activity in the cyclization of monoterpenes. The assemblies were investigated in detail with respect to a number of properties including the encapsulation of substrate and ion pairs, the structural incorporation of water, and the response to externally added acid (HCl). The results obtained strongly indicate that water incorporated into the hydrogen-bond network of the self-assembled structure plays an integral role for catalysis, effectively acting as a proton shuttle to activate the encapsulated substrate. These findings are also supported by molecular dynamics simulations, providing further insight into the protonation pathway and the relative energies of the intermediates involved.",2
"Triggered Release of Loads from Microcapsule-in-Microcapsule Hydrogel Microcarriers: En-Route to an ""Artificial Pancreas"".","A method to assemble stimuli-responsive nucleic acid-based hydrogel-stabilized microcapsule-in-microcapsule systems is introduced. An inner aqueous compartment stabilized by a stimuli-responsive hydrogel-layer ( approximately 150 nm) provides the inner microcapsule (diameter approximately 2.5 mum). The inner microcapsule is separated from an outer aqueous compartment stabilized by an outer stimuli-responsive hydrogel layer (thickness of approximately 150 nm) that yields the microcapsule-in-microcapsule system. Different loads, e.g., tetramethyl rhodamine-dextran (TMR-D) and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), are loaded in the inner and outer aqueous compartments. The hydrogel layers exist in a higher stiffness state that prevents inter-reservoir or leakage of the loads from the respective aqueous compartments. Subjecting the inner hydrogel layer to Zn(2+)-ions and/or the outer hydrogel layer to acidic pH or crown ether leads to the triggered separation of the bridging units associated with the respective hydrogel layers. This results in the hydrogel layers of lower stiffness allowing either the mixing of the loads occupying the two aqueous compartments, the guided release of the load from the outer aqueous compartment, or the release of the loads from the two aqueous compartments. In addition, a pH-responsive microcapsule-in-microcapsule system is loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) in the inner aqueous compartment and insulin in the outer aqueous compartment. Glucose permeates across the two hydrogel layers resulting in the GOx catalyzed aerobic oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid. The acidification of the microcapsule-in-microcapsule system leads to the triggered unlocking of the outer, pH-responsive hydrogel layer and to the release of insulin. The pH-stimulated release of insulin is controlled by the concentration of glucose. While at normal glucose levels, the release of insulin is practically prohibited, the dose-controlled release of insulin in the entire diabetic range is demonstrated. Also, switchable ON/OFF release of insulin is achieved highlighting an autonomous glucose-responsive microdevice operating as an ""artificial pancreas"" for the release of insulin.",2
Reducing Surface Halide Deficiency for Efficient and Stable Iodide-Based Perovskite Solar Cells.,"State-of-the-art, high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) contain a large amount of iodine to realize smaller bandgaps. However, the presence of numerous iodine vacancies at the surface of the film formed by their evaporation during the thermal annealing process has been broadly shown to induce deep-level defects, incur nonradiative charge recombination, and induce photocurrent hysteresis, all of which limit the efficiency and stability of PSCs. In this work, modifying the defective surface of perovskite films with cadmium iodide (CdI2) effectively reduces the degree of surface iodine deficiency and stabilizes iodine ions via the formation of strong Cd-I ionic bonds. This largely reduces the interfacial charge recombination loss, yielding a high efficiency of 21.9% for blade-coated PSCs with an open-circuit voltage of 1.20 V, corresponding to a record small voltage deficit of 0.31 V. The CdI2 surface treatment also improves the operational stability of the PSCs, retaining 92% efficiency after constant illumination at 1 sun intensity for 1000 h. This work provides a promising strategy to optimize the surface/interface optoelectronic properties of perovskites for more efficient and stable solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.",2
Cation Engineering in Two-Dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper Lead Iodide Perovskites with Mixed Large A-Site Cations in the Cages.,"The Goldschmidt tolerance factor in halide perovskites limits the number of cations that can enter their cages without destabilizing their overall structure. Here, we have explored the limits of this geometric factor and found that the ethylammonium (EA) cations which lie outside the tolerance factor range can still enter the cages of the 2D halide perovskites by stretching them. The new perovskites allow us to study how these large cations occupying the perovskite cages affect the structural, optical, and electronic properties. We report a series of cation engineered 2D Ruddlesden-Popper lead iodide perovskites (BA)2(EAxMA1-x)2Pb3I10 (x = 0-1, BA is n-butylammonium, MA is methylammonium) by the incorporation of a large EA cation in the cage. An analysis of the single-crystal structures reveals that the incorporation of EA in the cage significantly stretches Pb-I bonds, expands the cage, and induces a larger octahedral distortion in the inorganic framework. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies show that such structural deformation leads to a blue-shifted bandgap, sub-bandgap trap states with wider energetic distribution, and stronger photoluminescence quenching. These results enrich the family of 2D perovskites and provide new insights for understanding the structure-property relationship in perovskite materials.",2
Mechanistic Studies of the Palladium-Catalyzed Desulfinative Cross-Coupling of Aryl Bromides and (Hetero)Aryl Sulfinate Salts.,"Pyridine and related heterocyclic sulfinates have recently emerged as effective nucleophilic coupling partners in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with (hetero)aryl halides. These sulfinate reagents are straightforward to prepare, stable to storage and coupling reaction conditions, and deliver efficient reactions, thus offering many advantages, compared to the corresponding boron-derived reagents. Despite the success of these reactions, there are only scant details of the reaction mechanism. In this study, we use structural and kinetic analysis to investigate the mechanism of these important coupling reactions in detail. We compare a pyridine-2-sulfinate with a carbocyclic sulfinate and establish different catalyst resting states, and turnover limiting steps, for the two classes of reagent. For the carbocyclic sulfinate, the aryl bromide oxidative addition complex is the resting state intermediate, and transmetalation is turnover-limiting. In contrast, for the pyridine sulfinate, a chelated Pd(II) sulfinate complex formed post-transmetalation is the resting-state intermediate, and loss of SO2 from this complex is turnover-limiting. We also investigated the role of the basic additive potassium carbonate, the use of which is crucial for efficient reactions, and deduced a dual function in which carbonate is responsible for the removal of free sulfur dioxide from the reaction medium, and the potassium cation plays a role in accelerating transmetalation. In addition, we show that sulfinate homocoupling is responsible for converting Pd(OAc)2 to a catalytically active Pd(0) complex. Together, these studies shed light on the challenges that must be overcome to deliver improved, lower temperature versions of these synthetically important processes.",2
"Tuning the Redox Activity of Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced, Selective O2 Binding: Design Rules and Ambient Temperature O2 Chemisorption in a Cobalt-Triazolate Framework.","Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites are appealing as adsorbent materials due to their tunable functionality and ability to selectively bind small molecules. Through the use of computational screening methods based on periodic density functional theory, we investigate O2 and N2 adsorption at the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites of several MOF families. A variety of design handles are identified that can be used to modify the redox activity of the metal centers, including changing the functionalization of the linkers (replacing oxido donors with sulfido donors), anion exchange of bridging ligands (considering mu-Br(-), mu-Cl(-), mu-F(-), mu-SH(-), or mu-OH(-) groups), and altering the formal oxidation state of the metal. As a result, we show that it is possible to tune the O2 affinity at the open metal sites of MOFs for applications involving the strong and/or selective binding of O2. In contrast with O2 adsorption, N2 adsorption at open metal sites is predicted to be relatively weak across the MOF dataset, with the exception of MOFs containing synthetically elusive V(2+) open metal sites. As one example from the screening study, we predicted that exchanging the mu-Cl(-) ligands of M2Cl2(BBTA) (H2BBTA = 1H,5H-benzo(1,2-d:4,5-d')bistriazole) with mu-OH(-) groups would significantly enhance the strength of O2 adsorption at the open metal sites without a corresponding increase in the N2 affinity. Experimental investigation of Co2Cl2(BBTA) and Co2(OH)2(BBTA) confirms that the former exhibits weak physisorption of both N2 and O2, whereas the latter is capable of chemisorbing O2 at room temperature in a highly selective manner. The O2 chemisorption behavior is attributed to the greater electron-donating character of the mu-OH(-) ligands and the presence of H-bonding interactions between the mu-OH(-) bridging ligands and the reduced O2 adsorbate.",2
Electrolyte Reactivity in the Double Layer in Mg Batteries: An Interface Potential-Dependent DFT Study.,"The electrochemical degradation of two solvent-based electrolytes for Mg-metal batteries is investigated through a grand canonical density functional theory (DFT) approach. Both electrolytes are highly reactive in the double layer region where the solvated species have no direct contact with the Mg-surface, hence emphasizing that surface reactions are not the only phenomena responsible for electrolyte degradation. Applied to dimethoxyethane (DME) and ethylene carbonate (EC), the present methodology shows that both solvents should thermodynamically decompose in the double layer prior to the Mg(2+)/Mg(0) reduction, leading to electrochemically inactive reaction products. Based on thermodynamic considerations, Mg(0) deposition should not be possible, which contrasts with experiments, at least for DME-based electrolytes. This apparent contradiction is here addressed through the rationalization of the electrochemical mechanism underlying solvent electroactivation. An extended operation potential window (OPW) is extracted, in which the Mg(2+)/Mg(0) reduction can compete with electrolyte decomposition, thus enabling battery operation beyond the solvated species thermodynamic stability. The chemical study of the degradation products is in excellent agreement with experiments and offers rationale for the Mg-battery failure in EC electrolyte and capacity fade in DME electrolyte. The potential-dependent approach proposed herein is thus able to successfully tackle the challenging problem of interface electrochemistry. Being fully transferable to any other electrochemical systems, this methodology should provide rational guidelines for the development of viable electrolytes for multivalent batteries and, more generally, energy conversion and storage devices.",2
Proteomimetics as protein-inspired scaffolds with defined tertiary folding patterns.,"Proteins have evolved as a variable platform that provides access to molecules with diverse shapes, sizes and functions. These features have inspired chemists for decades to seek artificial mimetics of proteins with improved or novel properties. Such work has focused primarily on small protein fragments, often isolated secondary structures; however, there has lately been a growing interest in the design of artificial molecules that mimic larger, more complex tertiary folds. In this Perspective, we define these agents as 'proteomimetics' and discuss the recent advances in the field. Proteomimetics can be divided into three categories: protein domains with side-chain functionality that alters the native linear-chain topology; protein domains in which the chemical composition of the polypeptide backbone has been partially altered; and protein-like folded architectures that are composed entirely of non-natural monomer units. We give an overview of these proteomimetic approaches and outline remaining challenges facing the field.",2
In Situ Switching of Photoinduced Electron Transfer Direction by Regulating the Redox State in Fullerene-Based Dyads.,"Novel fullerene-based donor-acceptor (DA) dyads, Sc3N@C80-PTZ and C60-PTZ, have been synthesized and investigated in which the photoinduced electron transfer direction is proved to be switchable by regulating the redox state. In detailed photophysical experiments, reductive electron transfer from the PTZ moiety to Sc3N@C80 is confirmed with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy in the neutral Sc3N@C80-PTZ dyad. After oxidizing the PTZ moiety to PTZ(*+) in a reversible manner, oxidative electron transfer from the Sc3N@C80 moiety to the PTZ(*+) radical cation is corroborated experimentally and theoretically, leading to formation of a metastable charge transfer (CT) state (Sc3N@C80)(*+)-PTZ, which is not observed in the C60-PTZ(*+) dyad. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in situ tunable molecular photodiode-like behavior is fulfilled utilizing a fullerene dyad. These findings will contribute to the future application of fullerene-based DA conjugates in molecular electronic devices.",2
Combinatorial Studies of Palladium-Based Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Fuel Cells.,"Hydrogen fuel cells have emerged as promising, potentially renewable energy-based, energy conversion technologies for powering electric vehicles. However, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode has remained a longstanding challenge and requires the design of nonplatinum electrocatalysts with high activity and, ideally, low cost. Here, we present a combinatorial study of Pd-Cu thin-film electrodes with well-defined composition and structures, prepared by magnetron sputtering, as a fast method for assessing the ORR activity of binary alloys. This represents a facile catalyst screening method, using replaceable glassy carbon disk electrodes, which enables the rapid and reliable evaluation of ORR activity using standard rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements. Among nine Pd-Cu alloys, Pd50Cu50 was identified as the most promising composition for the ORR and employed as a target for nanoparticle synthesis. The PdCu nanoparticles, supported on carbon, achieved a mass-specific and surface-specific activity, 3 and 2.5 times, respectively, as high as Pd/C in 1 M KOH. PdCu/C further exhibited an impressive durability with only 3 and 13 mV negative shifts in the half-wave potential after 20000 and 100000 potential cycles, respectively. The combinatorial approach guiding the nanoparticle synthesis, described herein, provides an optimized high-throughput screening method for other binary or ternary alloys as fuel cell electrocatalysts.",2
Isotopically Directed Symmetry Breaking and Enantioenrichment in Attrition-Enhanced Deracemization.,"The evolution of homochirality via attrition-enhanced deracemization (AED) of enantiomorphic solids is carried out using molecules that differ only in the isotopic composition of a phenyl group positioned remote from the chiral center. Enantioenrichment consistently favors the enantiomorph containing a deuterated phenyl group over the protio or (13)C version, and the protio version is consistently favored over the (13)C version. While these isotopic compounds exhibit identical crystal structures and solubilities, the trend in deracemization correlates with melting points. Understanding the origin of this isotope bias provides fundamental clues about overcoming stochastic behavior to direct the stereochemical outcome in attrition-enhanced deracemization processes. The energy required for breaking symmetry with chiral bias is compared for this near-equilibrium AED process and the far-from-equilibrium Soai autocatalytic reaction. Implications for the origin of biological homochirality are discussed.",2
Hot Electrons Generated in Chiral Plasmonic Nanocrystals as a Mechanism for Surface Photochemistry and Chiral Growth.,"The realization of chiral photochemical reactions at the molecular level has proven to be a challenging task, with invariably low efficiencies originating from very small optical circular dichroism signals. On the contrary, colloidal nanocrystals offer a very large differential response to circularly polarized light when designed with chiral geometries. We propose taking advantage of this capability, introducing a novel mechanism driving surface photochemistry in a chiral nanocrystal. Plasmonic nanocrystals exhibit anomalously large asymmetry factors in optical circular dichroism (CD), and the related hot-electron generation shows in turn a very strong asymmetry, serving as a mechanism for chiral growth. Through theoretical modeling, we show that chiral plasmonic nanocrystals can enable chiral surface growth based on the generation of energetic (hot) electrons. Using simple and realistic phenomenological models, we illustrate how this kind of surface photochemistry can be observed experimentally. The proposed mechanism is efficient if it operates on an already strongly chiral nanocrystal, whereas our proposed mechanism does not show chiral growth for initially nonchiral structures in a solution. The asymmetry factors for the chiral effects, driven by hot electrons, exceed the values observed in chiral molecular photophysics at least 10-fold. The proposed chiral-growth mechanism for the transformation of plasmonic colloids is fundamentally different to the traditional schemes of chiral photochemistry at the molecular level.",2
Electron-Transfer and Redox Reactivity of High-Valent Iron Imido and Oxo Complexes with the Formal Oxidation States of Five and Six.,"We report for the first time electron-transfer (ET) properties of mononuclear nonheme iron-oxo and -imido complexes with the formal oxidation states of five and six, such as an iron(V)-imido TAML cation radical complex, which is formally an iron(VI)-imido complex [Fe(V)(NTs)(TAML(+*))] (1; NTs = tosylimido), an iron(V)-imido complex [Fe(V)(NTs)(TAML)](-) (2), and an iron(V)-oxo complex [Fe(V)(O)(TAML)](-) (3). The one-electron reduction potential (Ered vs SCE) of 1 was determined to be 0.86 V, which is much more positive than that of 2 (0.30 V), but the Ered of 3 is the most positive (1.04 V). The rate constants of ET of 1-3 were analyzed in light of the Marcus theory of adiabatic outer-sphere ET to determine the reorganization energies (lambda) of ET reactions with 1-3; the lambda of 1 (1.00 eV) is significantly smaller than those of 2 (1.98 eV) and 3 (2.25 eV) because of the ligand-centered ET reduction of 1 as compared to the metal-centered ET reduction of 2 and 3. In oxidation reactions, reactivities of 1-3 toward the nitrene transfer (NT) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to thioanisole and its derivatives and the C-H bond activation reactions, such as the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) of 1,4-cyclohexadiene, were compared experimentally. The differences in the redox reactivity of 1-3 depending on the reaction types, such as NT and OAT versus HAT, were interpreted by performing density functional theory calculations, showing that the ligand-centered reduction seen on ET reactions can switch to metal-centered reduction in NT and HAT.",2
Noncentrosymmetric Columnar Liquid Crystals with the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect for Organic Photodetectors.,"The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) has drawn intensive attention due to its unique features that cannot be accessed with the conventional photovoltaic effect. However, the BPVE is observed in noncentrosymmetric materials and has been studied mainly for inorganic materials. Here, we report a simple subphthalocyanine (SubPc) derivative that assembles into a noncentrosymmetric columnar liquid crystal with the help of a DC E-field. These columnar assemblies exhibit the BPVE over a wide range of wavelengths up to 650 nm. Furthermore, just by sandwiching this columnar assembly between two ITO electrodes, the resultant device reaches a light-on/off ratio, Ilight/Idark, as high as 6.6 x 10(3), indicating that the polar columnar assemblies with SubPcs are promising for photodetectors.",2
Sanger's Reagent Sensitized Photocleavage of Amide Bond for Constructing Photocages and Regulation of Biological Functions.,"Photolabile groups offer promising tools to study biological processes with high spatial and temporal control. In the investigation, we designed and prepared several new glycine amide derivatives of Sanger's reagent and demonstrated that they serve as a new class of photocages for Zn(2+) and an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. We showed that the mechanism for photocleavage of these substances involves initial light-driven cyclization between the 2,4-dinitrophenyl and glycine methylene groups to form acyl benzimidazole N-oxides, which undergo secondary photoinduced decarboxylation in association with rupture of an amide bond. The cleavage reactions proceed with modest to high quantum yields. We demonstrated that these derivatives can be used in targeted intracellular delivery of Zn(2+), fluorescent imaging by light-triggered Zn(2+) release, and regulation of biological processes including the enzymatic activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), negative regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), and pulse rate of cardiomyocytes. The successful proof-of-concept examples described above open a new avenue for using Sanger's reagent-based glycine amides as photocages for the exploration of complex cellular functions and signaling pathways.",2
Hydrogen Stabilized RhPdH 2D Bimetallene Nanosheets for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution.,"The design of catalysts with high activity and robust stability for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a great challenge. Here, we report an efficient catalyst of two-dimensional bimetallene hydrides, in which H atoms stabilize the rhodium palladium bimetallene. The system exists because of the introduction of H that is in situ chemically released from the formaldehyde solution during the synthesis. This provides a highly stable catalyst based on an unstable combination of metal elements. Density functional theory calculations show the H is confined by electronic interactions and the Miedema rule of reverse stability of the RhPd alloy. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding alkaline HER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 40 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability for over 10 h at 100 mA cm(-2). The experimental results show that the confined H improve the activity, while the ultrathin sheet-like morphology yields stability. Our work provides guidance for synthesizing high-activity catalysts by confining heteroatoms into the crystal lattice of bimetallene and also a very novel mechanism for the growth of bimetallene made of highly immiscible components.",2
Catalytic Gels for a Prebiotically Relevant Asymmetric Aldol Reaction in Water: From Organocatalyst Design to Hydrogel Discovery and Back Again.,"This paper reports an investigation into organocatalytic hydrogels as prebiotically relevant systems. Gels are interesting prebiotic reaction media, combining heterogeneous and homogeneous characteristics with a structurally organized active ""solid-like"" catalyst separated from the surrounding environment, yet in intimate contact with the solution phase and readily accessible via ""liquid-like"" diffusion. A simple self-assembling glutamine amide derivative 1 was initially found to catalyze a model aldol reaction between cyclohexanone and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, but it did not maintain its gel structure during reaction. In this study, it was observed that compound 1 could react directly with the benzaldehyde to form a hydrogel in situ based on Schiff base 2 as a low-molecular-weight gelator (LMWG). This new dynamic gel is a rare example of a two-component self-assembled LMWG hydrogel and was fully characterized. It was demonstrated that glutamine amide 1 could select an optimal aldehyde component and preferentially assemble from mixtures. In the hunt for an organocatalyst, reductive conditions were applied to the Schiff base to yield secondary amine 3, which is also a highly effective hydrogelator at very low loadings with a high degree of nanoscale order. Most importantly, the hydrogel based on 3 catalyzed the prebiotically relevant aldol dimerization of glycolaldehyde to give threose and erythrose. In buffered conditions, this reaction gave excellent conversions, good diastereoselectivity, and some enantioselectivity. Catalysis using the hydrogel of 3 was much better than that using non-assembled 3-demonstrating a clear benefit of self-assembly. The results suggest that hydrogels offer a potential strategy by which prebiotic reactions can be promoted using simple, prebiotically plausible LMWGs that can selectively self-organize from complex mixtures. Such processes may have been of prebiotic importance.",2
Spontaneous Emergence of Self-Replicating Molecules Containing Nucleobases and Amino Acids.,"The conditions that led to the formation of the first organisms and the ways that life originates from a lifeless chemical soup are poorly understood. The recent hypothesis of ""RNA-peptide coevolution"" suggests that the current close relationship between amino acids and nucleobases may well have extended to the origin of life. We now show how the interplay between these compound classes can give rise to new self-replicating molecules using a dynamic combinatorial approach. We report two strategies for the fabrication of chimeric amino acid/nucleobase self-replicating macrocycles capable of exponential growth. The first one relies on mixing nucleobase- and peptide-based building blocks, where the ligation of these two gives rise to highly specific chimeric ring structures. The second one starts from peptide nucleic acid (PNA) building blocks in which nucleobases are already linked to amino acids from the start. While previously reported nucleic acid-based self-replicating systems rely on presynthesis of (short) oligonucleotide sequences, self-replication in the present systems start from units containing only a single nucleobase. Self-replication is accompanied by self-assembly, spontaneously giving rise to an ordered one-dimensional arrangement of nucleobase nanostructures.",2
Ligand-Controlled Product Selectivity in Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction Using Manganese Bipyridine Catalysts.,"Electrocatalysis is a promising tool for utilizing carbon dioxide as a feedstock in the chemical industry. However, controlling the selectivity for different CO2 reduction products remains a major challenge. We report a series of manganese carbonyl complexes with elaborated bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands that can reduce CO2 to either formic acid, if the ligand structure contains strategically positioned tertiary amines, or CO, if the amine groups are absent in the ligand or are placed far from the metal center. The amine-modified complexes are benchmarked to be among the most active catalysts for reducing CO2 to formic acid, with a maximum turnover frequency of up to 5500 s(-1) at an overpotential of 630 mV. The conversion even works at overpotentials as low as 300 mV, although through an alternative mechanism. Mechanistically, the formation of a Mn-hydride species aided by in situ protonated amine groups was determined to be a key intermediate by cyclic voltammetry, (1)H NMR, DFT calculations, and infrared spectroelectrochemistry.",2
"Liquid Organic Frameworks: The Single-Network ""Plumber's Nightmare"" Bicontinuous Cubic Liquid Crystal.","Novel bolapolyphiles, built of a p-terphenyl or bistolane core with polar glycerol end-groups and two laterally attached n-alkyl or semiperfluoroalkyl chains, form the first ""single plumber's nightmare network"", the simplest soft-matter cubic phase (Pm3m). Its cage-like grid comprises bundles of aromatic rods lying along the cubic unit cell edges, connected by six-way hydrogen-bonded junctions. Side-chains fill the remaining volume of this unique noninterpenetrating liquid-crystalline organic framework.",2
Band Sharpening and Band Alignment Enable High Quality Factor to Enhance Thermoelectric Performance in n-Type PbS.,"Low-cost and earth-abundant PbS-based thermoelectrics are expected to be an alternative for PbTe, and have attracted extensive attentions from thermoelectric community. Herein, a maximum ZT (ZTmax) approximately 1.3 at 923 K in n-type PbS is obtained through synergistically optimizing quality factor with Sn alloying and PbTe phase incorporation. It is found that Sn alloying in PbS can sharpen the conduction band shape to balance the contradictory interrelationship between carrier mobility and effective mass, accordingly, a peak power factor of approximately 19.8 muWcm(-1)K(-2) is achieved. Besides band sharpening, Sn alloying can also narrow the band gap of PbS so as to make the conduction band position between Pb0.94Sn0.06S and PbTe well aligned, which can benefit high carrier mobility. Therefore, incorporating the PbTe phase into the Pb0.94Sn0.06S matrix can not only favorably maintain the carrier mobility at approximately 150 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) but also suppress the lattice thermal conductivity to approximately 0.61 Wm(-1)K(-1) in Pb0.94Sn0.06S-8%PbTe, which contributes to a largely enhanced quality factor. Consequently, an average ZT (ZTave) approximately 0.72 in 300-923 K is achieved in Pb0.94Sn0.06S-8%PbTe that outperforms other n-type PbS-based thermoelectric materials.",2
Bioelectrocatalytic Conversion from N2 to Chiral Amino Acids in a H2/alpha-Keto Acid Enzymatic Fuel Cell.,"Enzymatic electrosynthesis is a promising approach to produce useful chemicals with the requirement of external electrical energy input. Enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) are devices to convert chemical energy to electrical energy via the oxidation of fuel at the anode and usually the reduction of oxygen or peroxide at the cathode. The integration of enzymatic electrosynthesis with EFC architectures can simultaneously result in self-powered enzymatic electrosynthesis with more valuable usage of electrons to produce high-value-added chemicals. In this study, a H2/alpha-keto acid EFC was developed for the conversion from chemically inert nitrogen gas to chiral amino acids, powered by H2 oxidation. A highly efficient cathodic reaction cascade was first designed and constructed. Powered by an applied voltage, the cathode supplied enough reducing equivalents to support the NH3 production and NADH recycling catalyzed by nitrogenase and diaphorase. The produced NH3 and NADH were reacted in situ with leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) to generate l-norleucine with 2-ketohexanoic acid as the NH3 acceptor. A 92% NH3 conversion ratio and 87.1% Faradaic efficiency were achieved. On this basis, a H2-powered fuel cell with hyper-thermostable hydrogenase (SHI) as the anodic catalyst was combined with the cathodic reaction cascade to form the H2/alpha-keto acid EFC. After 10 h of reaction, the concentration of l-norleucine achieved 0.36 mM with >99% enantiomeric excess and 82% Faradaic efficiency. From the broad substrate scope and the high enzymatic enantioselectivity of LeuDH, the H2/alpha-keto acid EFC is an energy-efficient alternative to electrochemically produce chiral amino acids for biotechnology applications.",2
Metal-Diamidobenzoquinone Frameworks via Post-Synthetic Linker Exchange.,"Metal-organic frameworks with amidic linkers often exhibit exceptional physical properties, but, owing to their strong metal-nitrogen bonds, are exceedingly challenging to isolate through direct synthesis. Here, we report a route to access metal-diamidobenzoquinone frameworks from their dihydroxobenzoquinone counterparts via postsynthetic linker exchange. The parent compounds (Me2NH2)2[M2L3] (M = Zn, Mn; H2L = 2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxo-1,4-benzoquinone) undergo linker exchange upon exposure to a solution of monodeprotonated 2,5-diamino-3,6-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone or 2,5-diamino-3,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, proceeding through single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions. The presence of both types of linker in the resulting frameworks is confirmed by a combination of NMR, Raman, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopies. Moreover, the extent of linker exchange in the Zn frameworks is quantified using (13)C NMR spectroscopy, and spatially resolved EDX spectroscopy reveals the two types of linker to be homogeneously distributed within a crystal. Finally, we propose a tentative mechanism of linker exchange based on pKa measurements, considerations of framework solubility, and powder X-ray diffraction analysis. This work provides the first method to exchange organic linkers with different donor atoms in metal-organic frameworks and in doing so demonstrates exchange between linkers with donor atoms differing in acidity by a remarkable 11 units of pKa. Together, these results offer a potentially general synthetic strategy toward new materials with exotic metal-linker coordination modes.",2
Dynamic Atom Clusters on AuCu Nanoparticle Surface during CO Oxidation.,"Supported alloy nanoparticles are prevailing alternative low-cost catalysts for both heterogeneous and electrochemical catalytic processes. Gas molecules selectively interacting with one metal element induces a dynamic structural change of alloy nanoparticles under reaction conditions and largely controls their catalytic properties. However, such a multicomponent dynamic-interaction-controlled evolution, both structural and chemical, remains far from clear. Herein, by using state-of-the-art environmental TEM, we directly visualize, in situ at the atomic scale, the evolution of a AuCu alloy nanoparticle supported on CeO2 during CO oxidation. We find that gas molecules can ""free"" metal atoms on the (010) surface and form highly mobile atom clusters. Remarkably, we discover that CO exposure induces Au segregation and activation on the nanoparticle surface, while O2 exposure leads to the segregation and oxidation of Cu on the particle surface. The as-formed Cu2O/AuCu interface may facilitate CO-O interaction corroborated by DFT calculations. These findings provide insights into the atomistic mechanisms on alloy nanoparticles during catalytic CO oxidation reaction and to a broad scope of rational design of alloy nanoparticle catalysts.",2
Single-Crystal Polycationic Polymers Obtained by Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Photopolymerization.,"The efficient preparation of single-crystalline ionic polymers and fundamental understanding of their structure-property relationships at the molecular level remains a challenge in chemistry and materials science. Here, we describe the single-crystal structure of a highly ordered polycationic polymer (polyelectrolyte) and its proton conductivity. The polyelectrolyte single crystals can be prepared on a gram-scale in quantitative yield, by taking advantage of an ultraviolet/sunlight-induced topochemical polymerization, from a tricationic monomer-a self-complementary building block possessing a preorganized conformation. A single-crystal-to-single-crystal photopolymerization was revealed unambiguously by in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which was also employed to follow the progression of molecular structure from the monomer, to a partially polymerized intermediate, and, finally, to the polymer itself. Collinear polymer chains are held together tightly by multiple Coulombic interactions involving counterions to form two-dimensional lamellar sheets (1 nm in height) with sub-nanometer pores (5 A). The polymer is extremely stable under 254 nm light irradiation and high temperature (above 500 K). The extraordinary mechanical strength and environmental stability-in combination with its impressive proton conductivity ( approximately 3 x 10(-4) S cm(-1))-endow the polymer with potential applications as a robust proton-conducting material. By marrying supramolecular chemistry with macromolecular science, the outcome represents a major step toward the controlled synthesis of single-crystalline polyelectrolyte materials with perfect tacticity.",2
Proton Conductive Luminescent Thermometer Based on Near-Infrared Emissive {YbCo2} Molecular Nanomagnets.,"Lanthanide(III)-based coordination complexes have been explored as a source of bifunctional molecular materials combining Single-Molecule Magnet (SMM) behavior with visible-to-near-infrared photoluminescence. In pursuit of more advanced multifunctionality, the next target is to functionalize crystalline solids based on emissive molecular nanomagnets toward high proton conductivity and an efficient luminescent thermometric effect. Here, a unique multifunctional molecule-based material, (H5O2)2(H)[Yb(III)(hmpa)4][Co(III)(CN)6]2.0.2H2O (1, hmpa = hexamethylphosphoramide), composed of molecular {YbCo2}(3-) anions noncovalently bonded to acidic H5O2(+) and H(+) ions, is reported. The resulting Yb(III) complexes present a slow magnetic relaxation below 6 K and room temperature NIR 4f-centered photoluminescence sensitized by [Co(CN)6](3-) ions. The microporous framework, built on these emissive magnetic molecules, exhibits a high proton conductivity of the H-hopping mechanism reaching sigma of 1.7 x 10(-4) S.cm(-1) at 97% relative humidity, which classifies 1 as a superionic conductor. Moreover, the emission pattern is strongly temperature-dependent which was utilized in achieving a highly sensitive single-center luminescent thermometer with a relative thermal sensitivity, Sr > 1% K(-1) in the 50-175 K range. This work shows an unprecedented combination of magnetic, optical, and electrical functionalities in a single phase working as a proton conductive NIR-emissive thermometer based on Single-Molecule Magnets.",2
A Universal Machine Learning Algorithm for Large-Scale Screening of Materials.,"Application of machine learning (ML) methods for the determination of the gas adsorption capacities of nanomaterials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOF), has been extensively investigated over the past few years as a computationally efficient alternative to time-consuming and computationally demanding molecular simulations. Depending on the thermodynamic conditions and the adsorbed gas, ML has been found to provide very accurate results. In this work, we go one step further and we introduce chemical intuition in our descriptors by using the ""type"" of the atoms in the structure, instead of the previously used building blocks, to account for the chemical character of the MOF. ML predictions for the methane and carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of several tens of thousands of hypothetical MOFs are evaluated at various thermodynamic conditions using the random forest algorithm. For all cases examined, the use of atom types instead of building blocks leads to significantly more accurate predictions, while the number of MOFs needed for the training of the ML algorithm in order to achieve a specified accuracy can be reduced by an order of magnitude. More importantly, since practically there are an unlimited number of building blocks that materials can be made of but a limited number of atom types, the proposed approach is more general and can be considered as universal. The universality and transferability was proved by predicting the adsorption properties of a completely different family of materials after the training of the ML algorithm in MOFs.",2
Multiple Mechanisms Mapped in Aryl Alkyl Ether Cleavage via Aqueous Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation over Skeletal Nickel.,"We present here detailed mechanistic studies of electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) in aqueous solution over skeletal nickel cathodes to probe the various paths of reductive catalytic C-O bond cleavage among functionalized aryl ethers relevant to energy science. Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenolysis of aryl ethers is important both in hydrodeoxygenation of fossil fuels and in upgrading of lignin from biomass. The presence or absence of simple functionalities such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, methyl, or methoxyl groups is known to cause dramatic shifts in reactivity and cleavage selectivity between sp(3) C-O and sp(2) C-O bonds. Specifically, reported hydrogenolysis studies with Ni and other catalysts have hinted at different cleavage mechanisms for the C-O ether bonds in alpha-keto and alpha-hydroxy beta-O-4 type aryl ether linkages of lignin. Our new rate, selectivity, and isotopic labeling results from ECH reactions confirm that these aryl ethers undergo C-O cleavage via distinct paths. For the simple 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethane or its alcohol congener, 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol, the benzylic site is activated via Ni C-H insertion, followed by beta elimination of the phenoxide leaving group. But in the case of the ketone, 2-phenoxyacetophenone, the polarized carbonyl pi system apparently binds directly with the electron rich Ni cathode surface without breaking the aromaticity of the neighboring phenyl ring, leading to rapid cleavage. Substituent steric and electronic perturbations across a broad range of beta-O-4 type ethers create a hierarchy of cleavage rates that supports these mechanistic ideas while offering guidance to allow rational design of the catalytic method. On the basis of the new insights, the usage of cosolvent acetone is shown to enable control of product selectivity.",2
"Sc(3+)-Promoted O-O Bond Cleavage of a (mu-1,2-Peroxo)diiron(III) Species Formed from an Iron(II) Precursor and O2 to Generate a Complex with an Fe(IV)2(mu-O)2 Core.","Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) carries out methane oxidation at 4 degrees C and under ambient pressure in a catalytic cycle involving the formation of a peroxodiiron(III) intermediate (P) from the oxygenation of the diiron(II) enzyme and its subsequent conversion to Q, the diiron(IV) oxidant that hydroxylates methane. Synthetic diiron(IV) complexes that can serve as models for Q are rare and have not been generated by a reaction sequence analogous to that of sMMO. In this work, we show that [Fe(II)(Me3NTB)(CH3CN)](CF3SO3)2 (Me3NTB = tris((1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)methyl)amine) (1) reacts with O2 in the presence of base, generating a (mu-1,2-peroxo)diiron(III) adduct with a low O-O stretching frequency of 825 cm(-1) and a short Fe...Fe distance of 3.07 A. Even more interesting is the observation that the peroxodiiron(III) complex undergoes O-O bond cleavage upon treatment with the Lewis acid Sc(3+) and transforms into a bis(mu-oxo)diiron(IV) complex, thus providing a synthetic precedent for the analogous conversion of P to Q in the catalytic cycle of sMMO.",2
Extremely Stable Zeolites Developed via Designed Liquid-Mediated Treatment.,"Improving the stability of porous materials for practical applications is highly challenging. Aluminosilicate zeolites are utilized for adsorptive and catalytic applications, wherein they are sometimes exposed to high-temperature steaming conditions ( approximately 1000 degrees C). As the degradation of high-silica zeolites originates from the defect sites in their frameworks, feasible defect-healing methods are highly demanded. Herein, we propose a method for healing defects to create extremely stable high-silica zeolites. High-silica (SiO2/Al2O3 > 240) zeolites with *BEA-, MFI-, and MOR-type topologies could be stabilized by significantly reducing the number of defect sites via a liquid-mediated treatment without using additional silylating agents. Upon exposure to extremely high temperature (900-1150 degrees C) steam, the stabilized zeolites retain their crystallinity and micropore volume, whereas the parent commercial zeolites degrade completely. The proposed self-defect-healing method provides new insights into the migration of species through porous bodies and significantly advances the practical applicability of zeolites in severe environments.",2
Remote Nickel-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Arylation via Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer-Enabled C-C Bond Cleavage.,"Cross-coupling reactions for carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formation are of great importance in modern chemical synthesis. In addition to classical cross-couplings involving preformed or preactivated coupling partners, more recently breakthroughs have been made in the selective, direct coupling of abundant aliphatic carbon-hydrogen bonds using hydrogen atom transfer reactions in which the bond-dissociation energy is the thermodynamic driving force. The more challenging carbon-carbon bond activation is still rather underdeveloped due to the bond inertness. Herein, we report a mild and general strategy for the activation of a diverse set of readily available cyclic alcohols for the remote and site-specific arylation of ketones via the combination of photoredox-mediated multisite concerted proton-electron transfer (MS-PCET) and nickel catalysis. The current cross-coupling proceeds with the generation of an alkoxy radical utilizing bond-dissociation free energy (BDFE) as the thermodynamic driving force. Subsequently, the resulting remote carbon-centered radicals formed by C-C cleavage merge with the nickel catalytic cycle to create the challenging C(sp(3))-C(sp(2)) bonds.",2
Principle and design of pseudo-natural products.,"Natural products (NPs) are a significant source of inspiration towards the discovery of new bioactive compounds based on novel molecular scaffolds. However, there are currently only a small number of guiding synthetic strategies available to generate novel NP-inspired scaffolds, limiting both the number and types of compounds accessible. In this Perspective, we discuss a design approach for the preparation of biologically relevant small-molecule libraries, harnessing the unprecedented combination of NP-derived fragments as an overarching strategy for the synthesis of new bioactive compounds. These novel 'pseudo-natural product' classes retain the biological relevance of NPs, yet exhibit structures and bioactivities not accessible to nature or through the use of existing design strategies. We also analyse selected pseudo-NP libraries using chemoinformatic tools, to assess their molecular shape diversity and properties. To facilitate the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space, we identify design principles and connectivity patterns that would provide access to unprecedented pseudo-NP classes, offering new opportunities for bioactive small-molecule discovery.",2
Use of alpha-trifluoromethyl carbanions for palladium-catalysed asymmetric cycloadditions.,"The development of new methodologies that enable chemo- and stereoselective construction of fluorinated substituents, such as the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, plays an essential role in the synthesis of new pharmaceutical agents. The exceptional ability of the CF3 moiety to prevent in vivo metabolism as well as improve other pharmacological properties has led to numerous innovative strategies for installing this unique functional group. One potential yet underdeveloped approach to access these trifluoromethylated products is direct substitution of alpha-trifluoromethyl carbanions. Although the electron-withdrawing nature of the CF3 group should facilitate deprotonation of adjacent hydrogens, the propensity of the resulting carbanions to undergo alpha-elimination of fluoride renders this process highly challenging. Herein, we describe a new strategy for stabilizing and utilizing transient alpha-trifluoromethyl carbanions that relies on a neighbouring cationic pi-allyl palladium complex. These palladium-stabilized zwitterions participate in asymmetric [3 + 2] cycloadditions with a broad range of acceptors, generating valuable di- and trifluoromethylated cyclopentanes, pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans.",2
Redox-Responsive Host-Guest Chemistry of a Flexible Cage with Naphthalene Walls.,"""Naphthocage"", a naphthalene-based organic cage, reveals very strong binding (up to 10(10) M(-1)) to aromatic (di)cationic guests, i.e., the tetrathiafulvalene mono- and dication and methyl viologen. Intercalation of the guests between two naphthalene walls is mediated by C-H...O, C-H...pi, and cation...pi interactions. The guests can be switched into and out of the cage by redox processes with high binding selectivity. Oxidation of the flexible cage itself in the absence of a guest leads to a stable radical cation with the oxidized naphthalene intercalated between and stabilized by the other two. Encapsulated guest cations are released from the cavity upon cage oxidation, paving the way to future applications in redox-controlled guest release or novel stimuli-responsive materials.",2
S = 3 Ground State for a Tetranuclear Mn(IV)4O4 Complex Mimicking the S3 State of the Oxygen-Evolving Complex.,"The S3 state is currently the last observable intermediate prior to O-O bond formation at the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II, and its electronic structure has been assigned to a homovalent Mn(IV)4 core with an S = 3 ground state. While structural interpretations based on the EPR spectroscopic features of the S3 state provide valuable mechanistic insight, corresponding synthetic and spectroscopic studies on tetranuclear complexes mirroring the Mn oxidation states of the S3 state remain rare. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization by XAS and multifrequency EPR spectroscopy of a Mn(IV)4O4 cuboidal complex as a spectroscopic model of the S3 state. Results show that this Mn(IV)4O4 complex has an S = 3 ground state with isotropic (55)Mn hyperfine coupling constants of -75, -88, -91, and 66 MHz. These parameters are consistent with an alphaalphaalphabeta spin topology approaching the trimer-monomer magnetic coupling model of pseudo-octahedral Mn(IV) centers. Importantly, the spin ground state changes from S = 1/2 to S = 3 as the OEC is oxidized from the S2 state to the S3 state. This same spin state change is observed following oxidation of the previously reported Mn(III)Mn(IV)3O4 cuboidal complex to the Mn(IV)4O4 complex described here. This sets a synthetic precedent for the observed low-spin to high-spin conversion in the OEC.",2
Stereospecific Furanosylations Catalyzed by Bis-thiourea Hydrogen-Bond Donors.,"We report a new method for stereoselective O-furanosylation reactions promoted by a precisely tailored bis-thiourea hydrogen-bond-donor catalyst. Furanosyl donors outfitted with an anomeric dialkylphosphate leaving group undergo substitution with high anomeric selectivity, providing access to the challenging 1,2-cis substitution pattern with a range of alcohol acceptors. A variety of stereochemically distinct, benzyl-protected glycosyl donors were engaged successfully as substrates. Mechanistic studies support a stereospecific mechanism in which rate-determining substitution occurs from a catalyst-donor resting-state complex.",2
Tethered Counterion-Directed Catalysis: Merging the Chiral Ion-Pairing and Bifunctional Ligand Strategies in Enantioselective Gold(I) Catalysis.,"Tethering a metal complex to its phosphate counterion via a phosphine ligand enables a new strategy in asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis (ACDC). A straightforward, scalable synthetic route gives access to the gold(I) complex of a phosphine displaying a chiral phosphoric acid function. The complex generates a catalytically active species with an unprecedented intramolecular relationship between the cationic Au(I) center and the phosphate counterion. The benefits of tethering the two functions of the catalyst are demonstrated here in a tandem cycloisomerization/nucleophilic addition reaction, by attaining high enantioselectivity levels (up to 97% ee) at an unusually low 0.2 mol % catalyst loading. Remarkably, the method is also compatible with a silver-free protocol.",2
"Chemically Triggered Synthesis, Remodeling, and Degradation of Soft Materials.","Polymer topology dictates dynamic and mechanical properties of materials. For most polymers, topology is a static characteristic. In this article, we present a strategy to chemically trigger dynamic topology changes in polymers in response to a specific chemical stimulus. Starting with a dimerized PEG and hydrophobic linear materials, a lightly cross-linked polymer, and a cross-linked hydrogel, transformations into an amphiphilic linear polymer, lightly cross-linked and linear random copolymers, a cross-linked polymer, and three different hydrogel matrices were achieved via two controllable cross-linking reactions: reversible conjugate additions and thiol-disulfide exchange. Significantly, all the polymers, before or after topological changes, can be triggered to degrade into thiol- or amine-terminated small molecules. The controllable transformations of polymeric morphologies and their degradation herald a new generation of smart materials.",2
Mode Specificity in the OH + HO2 --> H2O + O2 Reaction: Enhancement of Reactivity by Exciting a Spectator Mode.,"A reaction typically involves a few active modes while the other modes are largely preserved throughout the reaction as spectators. Excitation of an active mode is expected to promote the reaction, but depositing energy in a spectator mode typically has no effect, because of the differing ability for energy flow to the reaction coordinate. In this work, we report a surprising case of mode specificity in a key radical-radical reaction OH + HO2 --> H2O + O2, where such canonical expectations fail to hold. Despite its spectator nature, the vibrational excitation of the OH reactant is shown at low collision energies to enhance the reactivity significantly. This unique effect can be attributed to the increased attraction with HO2 due to the larger dipole of the stretched OH. At low collision energies, the stronger attraction increases the chance of capturing the reactants to form a hydrogen-bonded complex, thus of passing through the submerged barrier. The novel mechanism differs from the conventional vibrational enhancement via coupling to the reaction coordinate at the transition state, enriching our understanding of mode specificity in chemistry.",2
Dehydrogenative Coupling of Benzylic and Aldehydic C-H Bonds.,"A photoinduced dehydrogenative coupling reaction between benzylic and aldehydic C-H bonds is reported. When a solution of an alkylbenzene and an aldehyde in ethyl acetate is irradiated with visible light in the presence of iridium and nickel catalysts, a coupled alpha-aryl ketone is formed with evolution of dihydrogen. An analogous C-C bond forming reaction occurs between a C-H bond next to the nitrogen of an N-methylamide and an aldehydic C-H bond to produce an alpha-amino ketone. These reactions provide a straightforward pathway from readily available materials leading to valued structural motifs of pharmacological relevance.",2
Glutaraldehyde Cross-Linking of Oligolysines Coating DNA Origami Greatly Reduces Susceptibility to Nuclease Degradation.,"DNA nanostructures (DNs) have garnered a large amount of interest as a potential therapeutic modality. However, DNs are prone to nuclease-mediated degradation and are unstable in low Mg(2+) conditions; this greatly limits their utility in physiological settings. Previously, PEGylated oligolysines were found to protect DNs against low-salt denaturation and to increase nuclease resistance by up to approximately 400-fold. Here we demonstrate that glutaraldehyde cross-linking of PEGylated oligolysine-coated DNs extends survival by up to another approximately 250-fold to >48 h during incubation with 2600 times the physiological concentration of DNase I. DNA origami with cross-linked oligolysine coats are non-toxic and are internalized into cells more readily than non-cross-linked origami. Our strategy provides an off-the-shelf and generalizable method for protecting DNs in vivo.",2
Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics of CdSe Quantum-Dot-Doped Glasses.,"We have probed the local atomic structure of the interface between a CdSe quantum dot (QD) and a sodium silicate glass matrix. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we determined the structural properties and bond lengths, in excellent agreement with previous experimental observations. On the basis of an analysis of radial distribution functions, coordination environment, and ring structures, we demonstrate that an important structural reconstruction occurs at the interface between the CdSe QD and the glass matrix. The incorporation of the CdSe QD disrupts the Na-O bonds, while stronger SiO4 tetrahedra are reformed. The existence of the glass matrix breaks the stable 4-membered (4MR) and 6-membered (6MR) Cd-Se rings, and we observe a disassociated Cd atom migrated in the glass matrix. Besides, the formation of Se-Na and Cd-O linkages is observed at the CdSe QD/glass interface. These results significantly extend our understanding of the interfacial structure of CdSe QD-doped glasses and provide physical and chemical insight into the possible defect structure origin of CdSe QD, of interest to the fabrication of the highly luminescent CdSe QD-doped glasses.",2
Exploring Coupled Redox and pH Processes with a Force-Field-Based Approach: Applications to Five Different Systems.,"Coupled redox and pH-driven processes are at the core of many important biological mechanisms. As the distribution of protonation and redox states in a system is associated with the pH and redox potential of the solution, having efficient computational tools that can simulate under these conditions becomes very important. Such tools have the potential to provide information that complement and drive experiments. In previous publications we have presented the implementation of the constant pH and redox potential molecular dynamics (C(pH,E)MD) method in AMBER and we have shown how multidimensional replica exchange can be used to significantly enhance the convergence efficiency of our simulations. In the current work, after an improvement in our C(pH,E)MD approach that allows a given residue to be simultaneously pH- and redox-active, we have employed our methodologies to study five different systems of interest in the literature. We present results for capped tyrosine dipeptide, two maquette systems containing one pH- and redox-active tyrosine (alpha3Y and peptide A), and two proteins that contain multiple heme groups (diheme cytochrome c from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough cytochrome c3). We show that our results can provide new insights into previous theoretical and experimental findings by using a fully force-field-based and GPU-accelerated approach, which allows the simulations to be executed with high computational performance.",2
Water-Soluble Flexible Organic Frameworks That Include and Deliver Proteins.,"Four water-soluble hydrazone-based three-dimensional (3D) flexible organic frameworks FOF-1-4 have been synthesized from a semirigid tetracationic tetraaldehyde and four flexible dihydrazides. (1)H NMR spectroscopy indicated the quantitative formation of FOF-1-4 in D2O, while dynamic light scattering experiments revealed that, depending on the concentration, these porous frameworks display hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 50 to 120 nm. The porosity of the frameworks is confirmed by ethanol vapor adsorption experiments of the solid samples as well as the high loading capacity for a 2.3 nm porphyrin guest in water. The new water-soluble frameworks exhibit low cytotoxicity and form inherent pores with diameters of 5.3 or 6.7 nm, allowing rapid inclusion of proteins such as bovine serum albumin and green and orange fluorescent proteins, and efficient delivery of the proteins into normal and cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysis reveals percentages of the delivered cells up to 99.8%.",2
Diversion of Catalytic C-N Bond Formation to Catalytic Oxidation of NH3 through Modification of the Hydrogen Atom Abstractor.,"We report that (TMP)Ru(NH3)2 (TMP = tetramesitylporphryin) is a molecular catalyst for oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen. An aryloxy radical, tri-tert-butylphenoxyl (ArO.), abstracts H atoms from a bound ammonia ligand of (TMP)Ru(NH3)2, leading to the discovery of a new catalytic C-N coupling to the para position of ArO. to form 4-amino-2,4,6-tri-tert-butylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one. Modification of the aryloxy radical to 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-tritylphenoxyl radical, which contains a trityl group at the para position, prevents C-N coupling and diverts the reaction to catalytic oxidation of NH3 to give N2. We achieved 125 +/- 5 turnovers at 22 degrees C for oxidation of NH3, the highest turnover number (TON) reported to date for a molecular catalyst.",2
A Boron Activating Effect Enables Cobalt-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Sterically Hindered Alkenes.,"Unsymmetric 1,1-diboryl alkenes bearing one -[BPin] (BPin = pinacolatoboryl) and one -[BDan] (BDan = 1,8-diaminonaphthalatoboryl) substituent each were hydrogenated in high yield and enantioselectivity using C1-symmetric pyridine(diimine) (PDI) cobalt complexes. High activities and stereoselectivities were observed with an array of 2-alkyl-, 2-aryl-, and 2-boryl-substituted 1,1-diboryl alkenes, giving rise to enantioenriched diborylalkane building blocks. Systematic study of substrate substituent effects identified competing steric and electronic demands in the key activating role of the boron substituents, whereby sterically unencumbered boronates such as -[BDan], -[BCat] (BCat = catecholatoboryl), and -[Beg] (Beg = ethylene glycolatoboryl) promote the hydrogenation of trisubstituted alkenes by enabling irreversible alpha-boron-directed insertion pathways to achieve otherwise challenging hydrogenations of trisubstituted alkenes. Deuterium-labeling studies with 1,1-diboryl alkenes support an insertion pathway generating a chiral intermediate with two different boron substituents and cobalt bound to the same carbon.",2
Selectively Addressable Photogenerated Spin Qubit Pairs in DNA Hairpins.,"Photoinduced electron transfer can produce radical pairs having two quantum entangled electron spins that can act as spin qubits in quantum information applications. Manipulation of these spin qubits requires selective addressing of each spin using microwave pulses. In this work, photogenerated spin qubit pairs are prepared within chromophore-modified DNA hairpins with varying spin qubit distances, and are probed using transient EPR spectroscopy. By performing pulse-EPR measurements on the shortest hairpin, selective addressing of each spin qubit comprising the pair is demonstrated. Furthermore, these spin qubit pairs have coherence times of more than 4 mus, which provides a comfortable time window for performing complex spin manipulations for quantum information applications. The applicability of these DNA-based photogenerated two-qubit systems is discussed in the context of quantum gate operations, specifically the controlled-NOT gate.",2
Ligand Conformational Bias Drives Enantioselective Modification of a Surface-Exposed Lysine on Hsp90.,"Targeted covalent modification of surface-exposed lysines is challenging due to their low intrinsic reactivity and high prevalence throughout the proteome. Strategies for optimizing the rate of covalent bond formation by a reversibly bound inhibitor (kinact) typically involve increasing the reactivity of the electrophile, which increases the risk of off-target modification. Here, we employ an alternative approach for increasing kinact of a lysine-targeted covalent Hsp90 inhibitor, independent of the reversible binding affinity (Ki) or the intrinsic electrophilicity. Starting with a noncovalent ligand, we appended a chiral, conformationally constrained linker, which orients an arylsulfonyl fluoride to react rapidly and enantioselectively with Lys58 on the surface of Hsp90. Biochemical experiments and high-resolution crystal structures of covalent and noncovalent ligand/Hsp90 complexes provide mechanistic insights into the role of ligand conformation in the observed enantioselectivity. Finally, we demonstrate selective covalent targeting of cellular Hsp90, which results in a prolonged heat shock response despite concomitant degradation of the covalent ligand/Hsp90 complex. Our work highlights the potential of engineering ligand conformational constraints to dramatically accelerate covalent modification of a distal, poorly nucleophilic lysine on the surface of a protein target.",2
Histone H2A Ubiquitination Reinforces Mechanical Stability and Asymmetry at the Single-Nucleosome Level.,"Monoubiquitination at lysine 119 of histone H2A (ubH2A) is a prevalent post-translational modification that is associated with gene repression in the context of chromatin. However, the direct function of ubH2A on nucleosome is poorly understood. Here we identified the effect of ubH2A on nucleosome using single-molecule magnetic tweezers. We revealed that ubH2A stabilizes the nucleosome by blocking the peeling of DNA from the histone octamer. Each ubH2A reinforces one-half of the outer wrap and introduces a robust asymmetry for nucleosome unfolding. Furthermore, a real-time deubiquitination process confirmed that ubH2A-nucleosome is sequentially deubiquitinated and restored to the unmodified nucleosome state. These results provide a novel mechanism to understand the repression of the passage of RNA or DNA polymerases through the ubH2A-nucleosome barrier during gene transcription or replication.",2
Ynamide Smiles Rearrangement Triggered by Visible-Light-Mediated Regioselective Ketyl-Ynamide Coupling: Rapid Access to Functionalized Indoles and Isoquinolines.,"In the past decades, significant advances have been made on radical Smiles rearrangement. However, the eventually formed radical intermediates in these reactions are limited to the amidyl radical, except for the few examples initiated by a N-centered radical. Here, a novel and practical radical Smiles rearrangement triggered by photoredox-catalyzed regioselective ketyl-ynamide coupling is reported, which represents the first radical Smiles rearrangement of ynamides. This method enables facile access to a variety of valuable 2-benzhydrylindoles with broad substrate scope in generally good yields under mild reaction conditions. In addition, this chemistry can also be extended to the divergent synthesis of versatile 3-benzhydrylisoquinolines through a similar ketyl-ynamide coupling and radical Smiles rearrangement, followed by dehydrogenative oxidation. Moreover, such an ynamide Smiles rearrangement initiated by intermolecular photoredox catalysis via addition of external radical sources is also achieved. By control experiments, the reaction was shown to proceed via key ketyl radical and alpha-imino carbon radical intermediates.",2
"Nitrogen-Rich Tetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine: Promising Building Block for Advanced Energetic Materials.","Two metal-free explosives, tetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-containing molecules [6-azido-8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-7-amine (3at) and 8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-6,7-diamine (6)], were obtained via straightforward two-step synthetic routes from commercially available reagents. Compound 3at displays an excellent detonation performance (Dv = 8746 m s(-1) and P = 31.5 GPa) that is superior to commercial primary explosives such as lead azide and diazodinitrophenol (DDNP). Compound 6 has superior thermal stability, remarkable insensitivity, and good detonation performance, strongly suggesting it as an acceptable secondary explosive. The initiating ability of compound 3at has been tested by detonating 500 mg of RDX with a surprisingly low minimum primary charge of 40 mg. The extraordinary initiating power surpasses conventional primary explosives, such as commercial DDNP (70 mg) and reported 6-nitro-7-azido-pyrazol[3,4-d][1,2,3]triazine-2-oxide (ICM-103) (60 mg). The outstanding detonation power of 3at contributes to its future prospects as a promising green primary explosive. In addition, the environmentally benign methodology for the synthesis of 3at effectively shortens the time from laboratory-scale research to practical applications.",2
Stepwise Folding and Self-Assembly of a Merocyanine Folda-Pentamer.,"Here we report a synthetic protocol toward a merocyanine (MC) pentamer 1 which represents the first merocyanine oligomer longer than a dimer. By continuously decreasing the solvent polarity, we demonstrate the stepwise folding from partially folded monomeric and dimeric MC subunits (in chloroform) up to the full pentamer pi-stack (in 75% methylcyclohexane/25% chloroform) and a subsequent self-assembly of pentamer 1 into larger aggregates (in 80% methylcyclohexane/20% chloroform). This hierarchical structure formation process became possible due to the predominant dipole-dipole interactions among MC dyes that allowed for a precise modulation of the energy landscape by the solvent polarity. This unprecedented stepwise control of dye assembly via hierarchical dipole-dipole interactions opens the door for a more precise control of dye-dye interactions in artificial multichromophoric ensembles.",2
Solid-State NMR Reveals the Structural Transformation of the TDP-43 Amyloidogenic Region upon Fibrillation.,"TDP-43 is a primary pathological hallmark protein of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which may exist in the form of amyloid inclusions in the cells of patients. In addition to serving as a biomarker for these diseases, TDP-43 can also directly trigger neurodegeneration. We previously determined the amyloidogenic core region of TDP-43 (residues 311-360) and showed by solution NMR that this region includes two alpha-helices [(321-330) and (335-343)] in solution. We suggested that the helix-to-sheet structural transformation initiates TDP-43 aggregation. In the present study, X-ray diffraction shows that TDP-43 (311-360) aggregates adopt a cross-beta structure. Thioredoxin (Trx)-fused TDP-43 (311-360) can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) before fibrillation, suggesting that phase separation is an intermediate step before amyloid formation. Solid-state NMR (SSNMR), carried out to elucidate the structural changes of TDP-43 (311-360) at the atomic level, indicates five beta-strands of the amyloids formed, with the major two beta-strands contributed by the first helical region in the solution structure. The NMR evidence is also in support of the fibril having a parallel in-register conformation, implying a mechanism in which the helix-helix interactions in LLPS are converted into beta-strand parallel lateral association upon fibrillation. Our studies have assigned many key interresidue interactions that contribute to the stability of the fibril, including F316 with I318 and Q327 and W334 with A325, A326, A329, and S332. SSNMR with (1)H detection reveals a unique close interaction between the indole Nepsilon1-Hepsilon1 of W334 and the side-chain carbonyl of Q343. This interaction could be a very important factor in initiating TDP-43 (311-360) folding/misfolding in LLPS.",2
Evidence for Ferroelectricity of All-Inorganic Perovskite CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots.,"The combination of ferroelectric-optical properties in halide perovskites has attracted tremendous interess because of its potential for optoelectronic and energy applications. However, very few reports focus on the ferroelectricity of all-inorganic halide perovskites quantum dots. Herein, we report a excellent ferroelectricity in CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) with a saturation polarization of 0.25 muC/cm(2). Differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electronic microscopy revealed that the mechanism of ferroelectric-paraelectric switching of CsPbBr3 QDs can be attributed to the phase transition from cubic phase (Pm3m) to the orthorhombic phase (Pna21). In the orthorhombic CsPbBr3, the distortion of octahedral [PbBr6](4-) structural units and the off-center Cs(+) generated the slightly separated centers of positive charge and negative charge, resulting in the ferroelectric properties. The variable-temperature emission spectrum from 328 to 78 K exhibits green luminescence and a gradual red shift due to the phase transition. This finding opens up an avenue to explore the ferroelectric-optical properties of inorganolead halide perovskites for high-performance multifunctional materials.",2
Understanding and Predicting Post H-Atom Abstraction Selectivity through Reactive Mode Composition Factor Analysis.,"The selective functionalization of C-H bonds is one of the Grails of synthetic chemistry. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity toward fast hydroxylation or radical diffusion (known as the OH-rebound and dissociation mechanisms) following H-atom abstraction (HAA) from a substrate C-H bond by high-valent iron-oxo oxidants is already encoded in the HAA step when the post-HAA barriers are much lower than the preceding one. By applying the reactive mode composition factor (RMCF) analysis, which quantifies the kinetic energy distribution (KED) at the reactive mode (RM) of transition states, we show that reactions following the OH-rebound coordinate concentrate the RM kinetic energy on the motion of the reacting oxygen atom and the nascent substrate radical, whereas reactions following the dissociation channel localize most of their kinetic energy in H-atom motion. These motion signatures serve to predict the post-HAA selectivity, and since KED is affected by the free energy of reaction and asynchronicity (factor eta) of HAA, we show that bimolecular HAA reactions in solution that are electron transfer-driven and highly exergonic have the lowest fraction of KED on the transferred H-atom and the highest chance to follow rebound hydroxylation. Finally, the RMCF analysis predicts that the H/D primary kinetic isotope effect can serve as a probe for these mechanisms, as confirmed in virtually all reported examples in the literature.",2
"Semisynthesis of Plant-Derived Englerin A Enabled by Microbe Engineering of Guaia-6,10(14)-diene as Building Block.","Herein, we report a short semisynthesis of the potent transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel agonist englerin A (EA) and the related guaianes oxyphyllol and orientalol E. The guaia-6,10(14)-diene starting material was systematically engineered in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and was produced with high titers. The potentially scalable approach combines the advantages of synthetic biology and chemical synthesis providing an efficient and economical method for producing EA and analogues.",2
Rhodium(I) Complex-Based Polymeric Nanomicelles in Water Exhibiting Coexistent Near-Infrared Phosphorescence Imaging and Anticancer Activity in Vivo.,"Metal complexes that exhibit both near-infrared (NIR) phosphorescence imaging and chemotherapeutic activity would represent a novel class of anticancer drugs in clinical tumor treatment. In this work, a series of novel rodlike nanomicelles have been fabricated in water by coupling poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(sodium acrylate) and [Rh(C identical withN-2,6-xylyl)4](+)((1)/2SO4)(-). These nanomicelles exhibit intense NIR phosphorescence and excellent stability. As revealed by in vivo NIR phosphorescence imaging data, the rodlike nanomicelle can selectively stain tumor sites with a long retention time. Moreover, the nanorods demonstrate effective anticancer activity by precisely killing tumor tissues without damaging healthy organs in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this research provides the first example of metal-based complexes showing simultaneous NIR luminescence imaging and antitumor activity in vivo.",2
Single-Atom Vacancy Defect to Trigger High-Efficiency Hydrogen Evolution of MoS2.,"Defect engineering is widely applied in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to achieve electrical, optical, magnetic, and catalytic regulation. Vacancies, regarded as a type of extremely delicate defect, are acknowledged to be effective and flexible in general catalytic modulation. However, the influence of vacancy states in addition to concentration on catalysis still remains vague. Thus, via high throughput calculations, the optimized sulfur vacancy (S-vacancy) state in terms of both concentration and distribution is initially figured out among a series of MoS2 models for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In order to realize it, a facile and mild H2O2 chemical etching strategy is implemented to introduce homogeneously distributed single S-vacancies onto the MoS2 nanosheet surface. By systematic tuning of the etching duration, etching temperature, and etching solution concentration, comprehensive modulation of the S-vacancy state is achieved. The optimal HER performance reaches a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 131 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), indicating the superiority of single S-vacancies over agglomerate S-vacancies. This is ascribed to the more effective surface electronic structure engineering as well as the boosted electrical transport properties. By bridging the gap, to some extent, between precise design from theory and practical modulation in experiments, the proposed strategy extends defect engineering to a more sophisticated level to further unlock the potential of catalytic performance enhancement.",2
"Phage-Guided Targeting, Discriminative Imaging, and Synergistic Killing of Bacteria by AIE Bioconjugates.","New agents with particular specificity toward targeted bacteria and superefficacy in antibacterial activity are urgently needed in facing the crisis of worldwide antibiotic resistance. Herein, a novel strategy by equipping bacteriophage (PAP) with photodynamic inactivation (PDI)-active AIEgens (luminogens with aggregation-induced emission property) was presented to generate a type of AIE-PAP bioconjugate with superior capability for both targeted imaging and synergistic killing of certain species of bacteria. The targeting ability inherited from the bacteriophage enabled the bioconjugates to specifically recognize the host bacteria with preserved infection activity of phage itself. Meanwhile, the AIE characteristic empowered them a monitoring functionality, and the real-time tracking of their interactions with targets was therefore realized via convenient fluorescence imaging. More importantly, the PDI-active AIEgens could serve as powerful in situ photosensitizers producing high-efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS) under white light irradiation. As a result, selective targeting and synergistic killing of both antibiotic-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were successfully achieved in in vitro and in vivo antibacterial tests with excellent biocompatibility. This novel AIE-phage integrated strategy would diversify the existing pool of antibacterial agents and inspire the development of promising drug candidates in the future.",2
Design of Substrate Transmembrane Mimetics as Structural Probes for gamma-Secretase.,"gamma-Secretase is a membrane-embedded aspartyl protease complex central in biology and medicine. How this enzyme recognizes transmembrane substrates and catalyzes hydrolysis in the lipid bilayer is unclear. Inhibitors that mimic the entire substrate transmembrane domain and engage the active site should provide important tools for structural biology, yielding insight into substrate gating and trapping the protease in the active state. Here, we report transmembrane peptidomimetic inhibitors of the gamma-secretase complex that contain an N-terminal helical peptide region that engages a substrate docking exosite and a C-terminal transition-state analog moiety targeted to the active site. Both regions are required for stoichiometric inhibition of gamma-secretase. Moreover, enzyme inhibition kinetics and photoaffinity probe displacement experiments demonstrate that both the docking exosite and the active site are engaged by the bipartite inhibitors. The solution conformations of these potent transmembrane-mimetic inhibitors are similar to those of bound natural substrates, suggesting these probes are preorganized for high-affinity binding and should allow visualization of the active gamma-secretase complex, poised for intramembrane proteolysis, by cryo-electron microscopy.",2
delta-C-H Mono- and Dihalogenation of Alcohols.,"Alkoxy radicals have long been known to enable remote C-H functionalization via 1,5-hydrogen atom abstraction. However, methods for their generation traditionally have relied upon highly oxidizing metals, ultraviolet radiation, or preformed peroxide intermediates, which has prevented the development of many desirable transformations. Herein we report a new bench-stable precursor that decomposes to free alkoxy radicals via a previously unreported single-electron oxidation pathway. This new precursor enables the fluorination and chlorination of remote C-H bonds under exceptionally mild conditions with exceedingly high monoselectivity. Iterative use of this precursor enables the introduction of a second halogen atom, granting access to remote dihalide motifs, including CF2 and CFCl.",2
Controllable Display of Sequential Enzymes on Yeast Surface with Enhanced Biocatalytic Activity toward Efficient Enzymatic Biofuel Cells.,"A precisely localized enzyme cascade was constructed by integrating two sequential enzymes, glucoamylase (GA) and glucose oxidase (GOx), on a yeast cell surface through an a-agglutinin receptor as the anchoring motif with cohesin-dockerin interaction. The overall catalytic activities of the combinant strains were significantly dependent on the assembly method, enzyme molecular size, enzyme order, and enzyme stoichiometry. The combinant strain with GA-DocC initially bound scaffoldin prior to GOx-DocT exhibited a higher overall reaction rate. The highest overall reaction rate (29.28 +/- 1.15 nmol H2O2 min(-1)mL(-1)) was achieved when GA/GOx ratio was 2:1 with enzyme order: yeast-GA-GOx-GA, 4-fold enhancement compared to free enzyme mixture. Further, the first example of starch/O2 enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) using codisplayed GA/GOx based bioanodes were assembled, demonstrating excellent direct biomass-to-electricity conversion. The optimized EBFC registered an open-circuit voltage of 0.78 V and maximum power density (Pmax) of 36.1 +/- 2.5 muW cm(-2), significantly higher than the Pmax for other starch/O2 EBFCs reported so far. Therefore, this work highlights rational organization of sequential enzymes for enhanced biocatalytic activity and stability, which would find applications in biocatalysis, enzymatic biofuel cells, biosensing, and bioelectro-synthesis.",2
Aromatic Nanosandwich Obtained by sigma-Dimerization of a Nanographenoid pi-Radical.,"A 139-pi-electron nanographenoid radical was obtained by expanding the periphery of a naphthalimide-azacoronene hybrid with a methine bridge. The radical was isolated in the form of its sigma-dimer, which was shown to possess a conformationally restricted two-layer structure both in the solid state and in solution. The dimer is cleaved into its parent radicals when exposed to ultraviolet or visible radiation in toluene solutions but is resistant to thermally induced dissociation. Under inert conditions, the radicals recombine quantitatively into the sigma-dimer with observable kinetics, but they are oxidized into a ketone derivative in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. Combined structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical evidence shows that the sigma-dimer contains a weak C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bond, but is stabilized against thermal dissociation by a very strong dispersive interaction between the overlapping pi surfaces.",2
Covalent on-surface polymerization.,"With the rapid development of scanning probe microscopy, it has become possible to study polymerization processes on suitable surfaces at the atomic level and in real space. In the two-dimensional confinement of a surface, polymerization reactions can give rise to the formation of unprecedented polymers with unique structures and properties, not accessible in solution. After a little over one decade since the discovery of covalent on-surface polymerization, we give an overview of the field, analyse the crucial aspects and critically reflect on the status quo. Specifically, we provide some general considerations about fundamental mechanisms as well as kinetics and thermodynamics of on-surface polymerization processes. The important role of the surface is detailed in view of its ability to control polymer formation with regard to structure, dimensionality and composition. Furthermore, examples that allow for locally induced polymerization are highlighted. Finally, we provide an analysis of scientific challenges in the field and outline future prospects.",2
Reticulating 1D Ribbons into 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks by Imine and Imide Linkages.,"The design and synthesis of 2D and 3D crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from macromolecular and even infinite building units is largely undeveloped. Here, we report a strategy to link molecules and 1D ribbons into 2D cystalline frameworks. Triangular, tris(4-aminophenyl)amine (TAA), and square, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-formylphenyl)pyrene (TFPPy), organic building units are joined substoichiometrically by imine linkages to produce 1D ribbons, termed COF-76, bearing free amines, which are then used to link the ribbons into 2D frameworks COF-77 and COF-78. In addition to this stepwise approach, we also demonstrate an in situ synthesis of these COFs. We believe our ability to link infinite building blocks, such as the ribbons of COF-76, into higher dimensionality COFs, paves the way to covalent frameworks composed of hierachical chemical structures.",2
Distal Alkenyl C-H Functionalization via the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis.,"A distal-selective alkenyl C-H arylation method is reported through a directed palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis. The key is to use an appropriate combination of the directing group and the NBE cocatalyst. A range of acyclic and cyclic cis-olefins are suitable substrates, and the reaction is operated under air with excellent site-selectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies are consistent with the proposed Pd/NBE-catalyzed C-H activation instead of the Heck pathway. Initial success on distal alkylation has also been achieved using MeI and methyl bromoacetate as electrophiles.",2
Visible-Light-Driven [2 + 2] Photocycloadditions between Benzophenone and C horizontal lineC Bonds in Unsaturated Lipids.,"The [2 + 2] photocycloaddition of alkenes and carbonyls is of fundamental interest and practical importance, as this process is extensively involved in oxetane-ring constructions. Although individual carbonyl group or alkene moiety has been utilized as photoactive species for oxetane formations upon ultraviolet photoexcitation, direct excitation of the entire noncovalent complex involving alkene and carbonyl substrates to achieve [2 + 2] photocycloadditions is rarely addressed. Herein, complexes with noncovalent interactions between benzophenone and C horizontal lineC bonds in unsaturated lipids have been successfully characterized, and for the first time a [2 + 2] cycloaddition leading to the formation of oxetanes has been identified under visible-light irradiation. The mechanism of this reaction is distinctly different from the well-studied Paterno-Buchi reaction. The entire complexes characterized as dimeric proton-bonded alkene and carbonyl substrates can be excited under visible light, leading to electron transfer from the alkene moiety in fatty acyls to the carbonyl group within the complex. These results provide new insight into utilizing noncovalent complexes for the synthesis of oxetanes in which the excitation wavelength becomes independent of each individual substrate.",2
Oriented External Electric Fields and Ionic Additives Elicit Catalysis and Mechanistic Crossover in Oxidative Addition Reactions.,"Judiciously applied oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) exert catalytic effects on the kinetics and improve the thermodynamics of chemical reactions. Herein, we examine the ability of OEEFs to assist catalysts and show that the rate of oxidative addition between palladium catalysts and alkyl/aryl electrophiles can be controlled by an OEEF applied along the direction of electron reorganization (the ""reaction axis""). The concerted mechanism of oxidative addition proceeds through a transition state with moderate charge transfer character. We demonstrate that OEEFs along the reaction axis can control this charge transfer and impart electrostatic catalysis. When the applied field exceeds a certain critical value ( approximately 0.15 V/A), we observed a mechanistic crossover from the concerted to a dissociative CSNAr type of reactivity for aryl electrophiles. To our surprise, alkyl electrophiles follow a hitherto unexplored SN2 pathway for the reaction with large transition state stabilization at relatively low OEEFs. A valence-bond state correlation diagram (VBSCD) is employed to comprehend the results. Finally, although the catalytic effect of salt additives in oxidative addition is known, its mechanism is still under debate. Our findings further show evidence that salt additives exert electric-field effects on the rate of cross-coupling reactions, and their cocatalytic effects can be judiciously reproduced by applied external electric fields. As such, we propose that the use of additives (anionic or cationic) is an experimentally viable strategy to implement external electric-field effects in routinely used oxidative addition catalysis.",2
Constructing High-Loading Single-Atom/Cluster Catalysts via an Electrochemical Potential Window Strategy.,"Single-atom catalysts (SACs) and single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) are the new frontier of heterogeneous catalysis, which exhibit high activity, selectivity, stability, and atomic efficiency as well as precise tunability. However, the lack of efficient methods for producing high-loading and high-purity SACs and SCCs hinders their industrial applications. In this work, we propose a general and efficient strategy for the production of high-loading and high-purity SACs and SCCs anchored on suitable substrates. Our strategy relies on the existence of an electrochemical potential window (EcPW) we predict within which any aggregate forms of the target metal on the substrate are leached away by electrochemical oxidation, while the strongly bound single atoms or single clusters remain at the substrate. We demonstrate the applicability of this strategy with modeling the production of Pt, Pd, and Ni SACs anchored on N-doped graphene and Fe2O3 as well as Pt3 and Ni3 SCCs anchored on graphdiyne.",2
Polysulfide Regulation by the Zwitterionic Barrier toward Durable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.,"Rational regulation on polysulfide behaviors is of great significance in pursuit of reliable solution-based lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery chemistry. Herein, we develop a unique polymeric zwitterion (PZI) to establish a smart polysulfide regulation in Li-S batteries. The zwitterionic nature of PZI integrates sulfophilicity and lithiophilicity in the matrix, fostering an ionic environment for selective ion transfer through the chemical interactions with lithium polysulfides (LiPS). When implemented as a functional interlayer in the cell configuration, PZI empowers strong obstruction against polysulfide permeation but simultaneously allows fast Li(+) conduction, thus contributing to significant shuttle inhibition as well as the resultant facile and stable sulfur electrochemistry. The PZI-based cells realize excellent cyclability over 1000 cycles with a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.012% per cycle and favorable rate capability up to 5 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity retention of 5.3 mAh cm(-2) after 300 cycles can be also obtained under raised sulfur loading and limited electrolyte, demonstrating great promise in developing high-efficiency and long-lasting Li-S batteries.",2
Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)-Corymine and (-)-Deformylcorymine.,"We report herein the first enantioselective total synthesis of akuammiline alkaloids (+)-corymine and (-)-deformylcorymine. Starting from commercially available N-nosyltryptamine, the target molecules are both achieved in 11 steps. Key elements of the design include (a) a copper-catalyzed enantioselective addition of dimethyl malonate to a 3-bromooxindole to secure the C7 all-carbon quaternary stereocenter, (b) a one-step construction of cyclohexyl and pyrrolidinyl rings via intramolecular nucleophilic C- and N-addition, and (c) a nickel-promoted 7-endo cyclization of alkenyl bromide to furnish the azepanyl ring. The strategy is further extended to the synthesis of another three members of the akuammiline family, namely, (-)-10-demethoxyvincorine, (-)-2(S)-cathafoline, and (-)-3-epi-dihydrocorymine 17-acetate.",2
Ultrafast Dynamics of Water-Protein Coupled Motions around the Surface of Eye Crystallin.,"Water dynamics on the protein surface mediate both protein structure and function. However, many questions remain about the role of the protein hydration layers in protein fluctuations and how the dynamics of these layers relate to specific protein properties. The fish eye lens protein gammaM7-crystallin (gammaM7) is found in vivo at extremely high concentrations nearing the packing limit, corresponding to only a few water layers between adjacent proteins. In this study, we conducted a site-specific probing of hydration water motions and side-chain dynamics at nine selected sites around the surface of gammaM7 using a tryptophan scan with femtosecond spectroscopy and NMR nuclear spin relaxation (NSR). We observed correlated fluctuations between hydration water and protein side chains on the time scales of a few picoseconds and hundreds of picoseconds, corresponding to local reorientations and network restructuring, respectively. These motions are heterogeneous over the protein surface and relate to the various steric and chemical properties of the local protein environment. Overall, we found that gammaM7 has relatively slower water dynamics within the hydration shell than a similar beta-sheet protein, which may contribute to the high packing limit of this unique protein.",2
Enhanced in Vivo Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration by Circular Tau-Transferrin Receptor Bifunctional Aptamer for Tauopathy Therapy.,"The lack of blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrating ability has hindered the delivery of many therapeutic agents for tauopathy treatment. In this study, we report the synthesis of a circular bifunctional aptamer to enhance the in vivo BBB penetration for better tauopathy therapy. The circular aptamer consists of one reported transferrin receptor (TfR) aptamer to facilitate TfR-aptamer recognition-induced transcytosis across BBB endothelial cells, and one Tau protein aptamer that we recently selected to inhibit Tau phosphorylation and other tauopathy-related pathological events in the brain. This novel circular Tau-TfR bifunctional aptamer displays significantly improved plasma stability and brain exposure, as well as the ability to disrupt tauopathy and improve traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced cognitive/memory deficits in vivo, providing important proof-of-principle evidence that circular Tau-TfR aptamer can be further developed into diagnostic and therapeutic candidates for tauopathies.",2
Quinazoline Ligands Induce Cancer Cell Death through Selective STAT3 Inhibition and G-Quadruplex Stabilization.,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein is a master regulator of most key hallmarks and enablers of cancer, including cell proliferation and the response to DNA damage. G-Quadruplex (G4) structures are four-stranded noncanonical DNA structures enriched at telomeres and oncogenes' promoters. In cancer cells, stabilization of G4 DNAs leads to replication stress and DNA damage accumulation and is therefore considered a promising target for oncotherapy. Here, we designed and synthesized novel quinazoline-based compounds that simultaneously and selectively affect these two well-recognized cancer targets, G4 DNA structures and the STAT3 protein. Using a combination of in vitro assays, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that these small, uncharged compounds not only bind to the STAT3 protein but also stabilize G4 structures. In human cultured cells, the compounds inhibit phosphorylation-dependent activation of STAT3 without affecting the antiapoptotic factor STAT1 and cause increased formation of G4 structures, as revealed by the use of a G4 DNA-specific antibody. As a result, treated cells show slower DNA replication, DNA damage checkpoint activation, and an increased apoptotic rate. Importantly, cancer cells are more sensitive to these molecules compared to noncancerous cell lines. This is the first report of a promising class of compounds that not only targets the DNA damage cancer response machinery but also simultaneously inhibits the STAT3-induced cancer cell proliferation, demonstrating a novel approach in cancer therapy.",2
Efficient Methane Electrosynthesis Enabled by Tuning Local CO2 Availability.,"The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to valuable chemicals is a promising avenue for the storage of intermittent renewable electricity. Renewable methane, obtained via CO2RR using renewable electricity as energy input, has the potential to serve as a carbon-neutral fuel or chemical feedstock, and it is of particular interest in view of the well-established infrastructure for its storage, distribution, and utilization. However, CO2RR to methane still suffers from low selectivity at commercially relevant current densities (>100 mA cm(-2)). Density functional theory calculations herein reveal that lowering *CO2 coverage on the Cu surface decreases the coverage of the *CO intermediate, and then this favors the protonation of *CO to *CHO, a key intermediate for methane generation, compared to the competing step, C-C coupling. We therefore pursue an experimental strategy wherein we control local CO2 availability on a Cu catalyst by tuning the concentration of CO2 in the gas stream and regulate the reaction rate through the current density. We achieve as a result a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of (48 +/- 2)% with a partial current density of (108 +/- 5) mA cm(-2) and a methane cathodic energy efficiency of 20% using a dilute CO2 gas stream. We report stable methane electrosynthesis for 22 h. These findings offer routes to produce methane with high FE and high conversion rate in CO2RR and also make direct use of dilute CO2 feedstocks.",2
Preserving the Exposed Facets of Pt3Sn Intermetallic Nanocubes During an Order to Disorder Transition Allows the Elucidation of the Effect of the Degree of Alloy Ordering on Electrocatalysis.,"Controlling which facets are exposed in nanocrystals is crucial to understanding different activity between ordered and disordered alloy electrocatalysts. We modify the degree of ordering of Pt3Sn nanocubes, while maintaining the shape and size, to enable a direct evaluation of the effect of the order on ORR catalytic activity. We demonstrate a 2.3-fold enhancement in specific activity by 60- and 30%-ordered Pt3Sn nanocubes compared to 95%-ordered. This was shown to be likely due to surface vacancies in the less-ordered particles. The greater order, however, results in higher stability of the electrocatalyst, with the more disordered nanoparticles showing the dissolution of tin and platinum species during electrocatalysis.",2
Addressing Ligand-Based Redox in Molybdenum-Dependent Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase.,"A combination of pulsed EPR, CW EPR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies has been employed to probe the geometric and electronic structure of the E. coli periplasmic molybdenum-dependent methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrP). (17)O and (1)H pulsed EPR spectra show that the as-isolated Mo(V) enzyme form does not possess an exchangeable H2O/OH(-) ligand bound to Mo as found in the sulfite oxidizing enzymes of the same family. The nature of the unusual CW EPR spectrum has been re-evaluated in light of new data on the MsrP-N45R variant and related small-molecule analogues of the active site. These data point to a novel ""thiol-blocked"" [(PDT)Mo(V)O(SCys)(thiolate)](-) structure, which is supported by new EXAFS data. We discuss these new results in the context of ligand-based and metal-based redox chemistry in the enzymatic oxygen atom transfer reaction.",2
Embedding Methods for Quantum Chemistry: Applications from Materials to Life Sciences.,"Quantum mechanical embedding methods hold the promise to transform not just the way calculations are performed, but to significantly reduce computational costs and improve scaling for macro-molecular systems containing hundreds if not thousands of atoms. The field of embedding has grown increasingly broad with many approaches of different intersecting flavors. In this perspective, we lay out the methods into two streams: QM:MM and QM:QM, showcasing the advantages and disadvantages of both. We provide a review of the literature, the underpinning theories including our contributions, and we highlight current applications with select examples spanning both materials and life sciences. We conclude with prospects and future outlook on embedding, and our view on the use of universal test case scenarios for cross-comparisons of the many available (and future) embedding theories.",2
Sequencing of Sequence-Defined Oligourethanes via Controlled Self-Immolation.,"Sequence-defined polymers show promise for biomimetics, self-assembly, catalysis, and information storage, wherein the primary structure begets complex chemical processes. Here we report the solution-phase and the high-yielding solid-phase syntheses of discrete oligourethanes and methods for their self-immolative sequencing, resulting in rapid and robust characterization of this class of oligomers and polymers, without the use of MS/MS. Crucial to the sequencing is the inherent reactivity of the terminal alcohol to ""unzip"" the oligomers, in a controlled and iterative fashion, releasing each monomer as a 2-oxazolidinone. By monitoring the self-immolation reaction via LC/MS, an applied algorithm rapidly produces the sequence of the oligourethane. Not only does this process provide characterization of structurally complex molecules, it works as a reader of molecular information.",2
Total Synthesis of Amphidinol 3: A General Strategy for Synthesizing Amphidinol Analogues and Structure-Activity Relationship Study.,"Amphidinol 3 (AM3) is a potent antifungal produced by the dinoflagellate Amphidinium klebsii. It was difficult to determine the absolute configuration of AM3 by using the scarce natural product due to the presence of numerous stereogenic centers on the acyclic carbon chain. Since the absolute configuration was partially determined on the basis of insufficient evidence, the originally proposed structure has been revised three times. Although recent progress on structure determination by computational analysis is remarkable, total synthesis is still the most reliable way to confirm structures. The first total synthesis of AM3 was achieved via expeditious assembly of three components in five steps, confirming the revised structure of AM3 after more than 20 years since its first discovery. The established synthetic route would be a general strategy for synthesizing amphidinol congeners. An artificial and simplified analogue of AM3, which elicited antifungal activity comparable to that of AM3, was designed and synthesized. This is the first example of a biologically active artificial analogue possessing a shorter polyol moiety, providing insight on the antifungal mode-of-action.",2
Differentiated Visualization of Single-Cell 5-Hydroxymethylpyrimidines with Microfluidic Hydrogel Encoding.,"5-Hydroxymethyluracil ( 5hmU ) is found in the genomes of a diverse range of organisms as another kind of 5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine, with the exception of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ). The biological function of 5hmU has not been well explored due to lacking both specific 5hmU recognition and single-cell analysis methods. Here we report differentiated visualization of single-cell 5hmU and 5hmC with microfluidic hydrogel encoding (sc 5hmU / 5hmC -microgel). Single cells and their genomic DNA after cell lysis can be encapsulated in individual agarose microgels. The 5hmU sites are then specifically labeled with thiophosphate for the first time, followed by labeling 5hmC with azide glucose. These labeled bases are each encoded into respective DNA barcode primers by chemical cross-linking. In situ amplification is triggered for single-molecule fluorescence visualization of single-cell 5hmU and 5hmC . On the basis of the sc 5hmU / 5hmC -microgel, we reveal cell type-specific molecular signatures of these two bases with remarkable single-cell heterogeneity. Utilizing machine learning algorithms to decode four-dimensional signatures of 5hmU / 5hmC , we visualize the discrimination of nontumorigenic, carcinoma and highly invasive breast cell lines. This strategy provides a new route to analyze and decode single-cell DNA epigenetic modifications.",2
Pore-Space-Partition-Enabled Exceptional Ethane Uptake and Ethane-Selective Ethane-Ethylene Separation.,"An ideal material for C2H6/C2H4 separation would simultaneously have the highest C2H6 uptake capacity and the highest C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. But such material is elusive. A benchmark material for ethane-selective C2H6/C2H4 separation is peroxo-functionalized MOF-74-Fe that exhibits the best known separation performance due to its high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (4.4), although its C2H6 uptake capacity is moderate (74.3 cm(3)/g). Here, we report a family of pore-space-partitioned crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with exceptional C2H6 uptake capacity and C2H6/C2H4 separation potential (i.e., C2H4 recovered from the mixture) despite their moderate C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (up to 1.75). The ethane uptake capacity as high as 166.8 cm(3)/g at 1 atm and 298 K, more than twice that of peroxo-MOF-74-Fe, has been achieved even though the isosteric heat of adsorption (21.9-30.4 kJ/mol) for these CPMs is as low as about one-third of that for peroxo-MOF-74-Fe (66.8 kJ/mol). While the overall C2H6/C2H4 separation potentials have not yet surpassed peroxo-MOF-74-Fe, these robust CPMs exhibit outstanding properties including high thermal stability (up to 450 degrees C) and aqueous stability, low regeneration energy, and a high degree of chemical and geometrical tunability within the same isoreticular framework.",2
Biomimetic Synthesis of Sub-20 nm Covalent Organic Frameworks in Water.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are commonly synthesized under harsh conditions yielding unprocessable powders. Control in their crystallization process and growth has been limited to studies conducted in hazardous organic solvents. Herein, we report a one-pot synthetic method that yields stable aqueous colloidal solutions of sub-20 nm crystalline imine-based COF particles at room temperature and ambient pressure. Additionally, through the combination of experimental and computational studies, we investigated the mechanisms and forces underlying the formation of such imine-based COF colloids in water. Further, we show that our method can be used to process the colloidal solution into 2D and 3D COF shapes as well as to generate a COF ink that can be directly printed onto surfaces. These findings should open new vistas in COF chemistry, enabling new application areas.",2
Reduced Enzyme Dynamics upon Multipoint Covalent Immobilization Leads to Stability-Activity Trade-off.,"The successful incorporation of enzymes into materials through multipoint covalent immobilization (MPCI) has served as the foundation for numerous advances in diverse fields, including biocatalysis, biosensing, and chemical weapons defense. Despite this success, a mechanistic understanding of the impact of this approach on enzyme stability has remained elusive, which is critical for realizing the full potential of MPCI. Here, we showed that the stabilization of lipase upon MPCI to polymer brush surfaces resulted from the rigidification of the enzyme with an increase in the number of enzyme-brush attachments. This was evident by a 10-fold decrease in the rates of enzyme unfolding and refolding as well as a reduction of the intrinsic fluctuations of the folded and unfolded states, which was measured by single-molecule (SM) Forster Resonance Energy Transfer imaging. Moreover, our results illuminate an important trade-off between stability and activity as a function of this decrease in structural dynamics of the immobilized lipase. Notably, as the thermal stability of lipase increased, as indicated by the temperature optimum for activity of the enzyme, the specific activity of lipase decreased. This decrease in activity was attributed to a reduction in the essential motions of the folded state that are required for catalytic turnover of substrate. These results provide direct evidence of this effect, which has long been a matter of speculation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the retention of activity and stabilization of an enzyme may be balanced by tuning the extent of enzyme attachment.",2
"Synthesis of Highly Twisted, Nonplanar Aromatic Macrocycles Enabled by an Axially Chiral 4,5-Diphenylphenanthrene Building Block.","The synthesis, structures, and properties of highly twisted, nonplanar aromatic macrocycles are described. These macrocycles with an approximately 90 degrees twist angle were synthesized by an effective synthetic approach through a quadruple Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of 4,5-bisarylphenanthrene, a novel axially chiral nonplanar building block. By varying the cross-coupling partner as the spacer, a family of twisted macrocycles was synthesized, allowing for a systematic study of the effect of the spacer on macrocycle shape and photophysical properties. For example, a unique macrocyclic aggregation-induced emission (AIE) emitter with double tetraphenylethylene units as the spacers was readily synthesized. Furthermore, attributed to its conformationally restricted twisted structure, a 3,6-disubstituted-1,8-naphthalimide-incorporated macrocycle showed remarkable solvatofluorochromism with high fluorescence quantum yields. The excellent conformational stability of these macrocycles further enabled complete enantiomeric resolution and characterization. The racemization barrier of macrocycle was determined experimentally and supported by DFT calculations.",2
X-ray Crystallography and Unexpected Chiroptical Properties Reassign the Configuration of Haliclonadiamine.,"Haliclonadiamine and papuamine are bis-indane marine natural products isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona sp. Their relative structures were previously reported to differ by inversion at only one of their eight shared stereocenters. Here X-ray crystallography shows the opposite to be true: papuamine has a 1R,3S,8R,9S,14S,15R,20S,22R configuration, while haliclonadiamine has a 1S,3R,8S,9R,14R,15S,20R,22R configuration. Paradoxically the ECD of each structure displays a negative Cotton effect. X-ray crystallography reveals the two structures adopt similar conformations of their 13-membered macrocyclic core that comprises a configurationally relevant diene. B97x-D/Def2-TZVPP-(MeOH)-calculated ECD supports the diene configuration with the macrocycle dominating the ECD Cotton effect for haliclonadiamine and papuamine. Additional crystallographic and chiroptical analyses of three sponge samples from geographically distant locations indicate this pair of natural products always exists as a configurationally related couple. The co-discovery of a biosynthetic precursor, halichondriamine C, present in these same Haliclona samples must be considered when discussing any biosynthetic pathway. Taken together, this work justifies a reassignment of haliclonadiamine's structure and opens the question of how this complex stereochemical relationship between haliclonadiamine and palauamine arises biosynthetically.",2
Functional Characterization and Structural Basis of an Efficient Di-C-glycosyltransferase from Glycyrrhiza glabra.,"A highly efficient di-C-glycosyltransferase GgCGT was discovered from the medicinal plant Glycyrrhiza glabra. GgCGT catalyzes a two-step di-C-glycosylation of flopropione-containing substrates with conversion rates of >98%. To elucidate the catalytic mechanisms of GgCGT, we solved its crystal structures in complex with UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP/phloretin, and UDP/nothofagin, respectively. Structural analysis revealed that the sugar donor selectivity was controlled by the hydrogen-bond interactions of sugar hydroxyl groups with D390 and other key residues. The di-C-glycosylation capability of GgCGT was attributed to a spacious substrate-binding tunnel, and the G389K mutation could switch di- to mono-C-glycosylation. GgCGT is the first di-C-glycosyltransferase with a crystal structure, and the first C-glycosyltransferase with a complex structure containing a sugar acceptor. This work could benefit the development of efficient biocatalysts to synthesize C-glycosides with medicinal potential.",2
High-Mobility Flexible Oxyselenide Thin-Film Transistors Prepared by a Solution-Assisted Method.,"Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors hold great promise in flexible electronics because of their intrinsic flexibility and high electrical performance. However, the lack of facile synthetic and subsequent device fabrication approaches of high-mobility 2D semiconducting thin films still hinders their practical applications. Here, we developed a facile, rapid, and scalable solution-assisted method for the synthesis of a high-mobility semiconducting oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) thin film by the selenization and decomposition of a precursor solution of Bi(NO3)3.5H2O. Simply by changing the rotation speed in spin-coating of the precursor solution, the thicknesses of Bi2O2Se thin films can be precisely controlled down to few atomic layers. The as-synthesized Bi2O2Se thin film exhibited a high Hall mobility of approximately 74 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at room temperature, which is much superior to other 2D thin-film semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides. Remarkably, flexible top-gated Bi2O2Se transistors showed excellent electrical stability under repeated electrical measurements on flat and bent substrates. Furthermore, Bi2O2Se transistor devices on muscovite substrates can be readily transferred onto flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrates with the help of thermal release tape. The integration of a high-mobility thin-film semiconductor, excellent stability, and easy transfer onto flexible substrates make Bi2O2Se a competitive candidate for future flexible electronics.",2
Nanopore Sequencing of an Expanded Genetic Alphabet Reveals High-Fidelity Replication of a Predominantly Hydrophobic Unnatural Base Pair.,"Unnatural base pairs (UBPs) have been developed and used for a variety of in vitro applications as well as for the engineering of semisynthetic organisms (SSOs) that store and retrieve increased information. However, these applications are limited by the availability of methods to rapidly and accurately determine the sequence of unnatural DNA. Here we report the development and application of the MspA nanopore to sequence DNA containing the dTPT3-dNaM UBP. Analysis of two sequence contexts reveals that DNA containing the UBP is replicated with an efficiency and fidelity similar to that of natural DNA and sufficient for use as the basis of an SSO that produces proteins with noncanonical amino acids.",2
Unveiling the Delicate Balance of Steric and Dispersion Interactions in Organocatalysis Using High-Level Computational Methods.,"High-level quantum electronic structure calculations are used to provide a deep insight into the mechanism and stereocontrolling factors of two recently developed catalytic asymmetric Diels-Alder (DA) reactions of cinnamate esters with cyclopentadiene. The reactions employ two structurally and electronically very different in situ silylated enantiopure Lewis acid organocatalysts: i.e., binaphthyl-allyl-tetrasulfone (BALT) and imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi). Each of these catalysts activates only specific substrates in an enantioselective fashion. Emphasis is placed on identifying and quantifying the key noncovalent interactions responsible for the selectivity of these transformations, with the final aim of aiding in the development of designing principles for catalysts with a broader scope. Our results shed light into the mechanism through which the catalyst architecture determines the selectivity of these transformations via a delicate balance of dispersion and steric interactions.",2
Increasing the Efficiency of Photocatalytic Reactions via Surface Microenvironment Engineering.,"The use of photocatalysis for water purification and environmental protection is of key interest. However, the reaction kinetics can be limited by the restricted accessibility of electron acceptor oxygen and the low adsorption of organic compounds-crucial factors underlying photocatalytic performance. Here we simultaneously alleviate these constraints via reaction interface microenvironment design using superhydrophobic (SHB) TiO2 nanoarrays as a model photocatalyst. The low surface energy and rough surface microstructure features of the SHB nanoarrays give the photocatalytic system long-range hydrophobic force and an air-water-solid triphase reaction interface. This simultaneously changes the adsorption model of organic compounds and the access pathway of oxygen, leading to a markedly enhanced adsorption capacity and higher interfacial oxygen levels. These synergistic qualities result in over 30-fold higher reaction kinetics versus a normal diphase system. In addition, this photocatalytic system is stable via repeated cycling. Our findings highlight the importance of reaction interface microenvironment design and reveal an effective path for the development of efficient photocatalysis systems.",2
Selective Formation of S4- and T-Symmetric Supramolecular Tetrahedral Cages and Helicates in Polar Media Assembled via Cooperative Action of Coordination and Hydrogen Bonds.,"We report on the synthesis and self-assembly study of novel supramolecular monomers encompassing quadruple hydrogen-bonding motifs and metal-coordinating 2,2'-bipyridine units. When mixed with metal ions such as Fe(2+) or Zn(2+), the tetrahedron cage complexes are formed in quantitative yields and full diastereoselectivity, even in highly polar acetonitrile or methanol solvents. The symmetry of the complexes obtained has been shown to depend critically on the flexibility of the ligand. Restriction of the rotation of the hydrogen-bonding unit with respect to the metal-coordinating site results in a T-symmetric cage, whereas introducing flexibility either through a methylene linker or rotating benzene ring allows the formation of S4-symmetric cages with self-filled interior. In addition, the possibility to select between tetrahedral cages or helicates and to control the dimensions of the aggregate has been demonstrated with a three-component assembly using external hydrogen-bonding molecular inserts or by varying the radius of the metal ion (Hg(2+) vs Fe(2+)). Self-sorting studies of individual Fe(2+) complexes with ligands of different sizes revealed their inertness toward ligand scrambling.",2
Helical Assemblies of One-Dimensional Supramolecular Polymers Composed of Helical Macromolecules: Generation of Circularly Polarized Light Using an Infinitesimal Chiral Source.,"We report the synthesis of one-dimensional supramolecular polymers composed of one-handed helical macromolecules bearing fluorescent pendant groups and the generation of circularly polarized light on the basis of hierarchical chiral amplification starting from a tiny amount of chiral substituent. Copolymerization of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-appended achiral/chiral isocyanides (99:1, mol/mol) with a solid-state photoluminescence feature afforded submicrometer supramolecular fibers, in which almost perfect single-handed helical polyisocyanides were noncovalently connected end to end. The resulting helical supramolecular polymers were further helically assembled to form a cholesteric liquid crystal film with an intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal. Surprisingly, the supramolecular system containing only 0.01 mol % of the chiral monomer unit also emitted the observable circularly polarized light owing to multiple chiral amplification from an infinitesimal point chirality to helical chirality and then to supramolecular chirality. Furthermore, chiral information was efficiently transferred from the helically assembled supramolecular system containing 1 mol % of the chiral unit to achiral dye molecules blended in the film, allowing full-color tunable induced CPL with luminescence dissymmetry factors greater than 1.0 x 10(-2). This unprecedentedly strong chiral amplification enables the creation of helical supramolecular polymers and chirally assembled systems with various chiral functions based solely on an infinitesimal chiral source.",2
Halogenated Metal-Organic Framework Glasses and Liquids.,"The synthesis of four novel crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) structures using a mixed-ligand approach is reported. The inclusion of both imidazolate and halogenated benzimidazolate-derived linkers leads to glass-forming behavior by all four structures. Melting temperatures are observed to depend on both electronic and steric effects. Solid-state NMR and terahertz (THz)/far-IR demonstrate the presence of a Zn-F bond for fluorinated ZIF glasses. In situ THz/far-IR spectroscopic techniques reveal the dynamic structural properties of crystal, glass, and liquid phases of the halogenated ZIFs, linking the melting behavior of ZIFs to the propensity of the ZnN4 tetrahedra to undergo thermally induced deformation. The inclusion of halogenated ligands within metal-organic framework (MOF) glasses improves their gas-uptake properties.",2
Helical Peptides Design for Molecular Dipoles Functionalization of Wide Band Gap Oxides.,"The use of helical hexapeptides to establish a surface dipole layer on a TiO2 substrate, with the goal of influencing the energy levels of a coadsorbed chromophore, is explored. Two helical hexapeptides, synthesized from 2-amino isobutyric acid (Aib) residues, were protected at the N-terminus with a carboxybenzyl group (Z) and at the C-terminus carried either a carboxylic acid or an isophthalic acid (Ipa) anchor group to form Z-(Aib)6-COOH or Z-(Aib)6-Ipa, respectively. Using a combination of vibrational and photoemission spectroscopies, bonding of the two peptides to TiO2 surfaces (either nanostructured or single-crystal TiO2(110)) was found to be highly dependent on the anchor group, with Ipa establishing a monolayer much more efficiently than COOH. Furthermore, a monolayer of Z-(Aib)6-Ipa on TiO2(110) was exposed for different binding times to a solution of a zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) derivative terminated with an Ipa anchor group (ZnTPP-P-Ipa). Photoemission spectroscopy revealed that ZnTPP-P-Ipa partly displaced Z-(Aib)6-Ipa, forming a coadsorbed monolayer on the oxide surface. The presence of the peptide molecular dipole shifted the HOMO levels of the ZnTPP group to lower energy by approximately 300 meV, in accordance with a simple parallel plate capacitor model. These results suggest that a mixed-layer approach, involving coadsorption of a strong molecular dipole compound with a chromophore, is a versatile method to shift the energy levels of such chromophores with respect to the band edges of the substrate.",2
Solution Synthesis of Layered van der Waals (vdW) Ferromagnetic CrGeTe3 Nanosheets from a Non-vdW Cr2Te3Template.,"CrGeTe3 has recently emerged as a new class of two-dimensional (2D) materials due to its intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order. However, almost all the reported synthesis methods for CrGeTe3 nanosheets are based on the conventional mechanical exfoliation from single-crystalline CrGeTe3, which is prepared by the complicated self-flux technique. Here we report a solution-processed synthesis of CrGeTe3 nanosheets from a non-van der Waals (vdW) Cr2Te3 template. This structure evolution from non-vdW to vdW is originated from the substitution of Ge atoms on the Cr sites surrounded by fewer Te atoms in the Cr2Te3 lattice due to their smaller steric hindrance and lower energy barrier. These CrGeTe3 nanosheets present regular hexagonal structures with a diameter larger than 1 mum and excellent stability. They exhibit soft magnetic behavior with a Curie temperature lower than 67.5 K. This non-vdW to vdW synthesis strategy promotes the development of CrGeTe3 in ferromagnetism while providing an effective route to synthesize other 2D materials.",2
"Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Tiancimycins A and B, Yangpumicin A, and Related Anthraquinone-Fused Enediyne Antitumor Antibiotics.","The family of anthraquinone-fused enediyne antitumor antibiotics was established by the discovery of dynemicin A and deoxy-dynemicin A. It was then expanded, first by the isolation of uncialamycin, and then by the addition to the family of tiancimycins A-F and yangpumicin A. This family of natural products provides opportunities in total synthesis, biology, and medicine due to their novel and challenging molecular structures, intriguing biological properties and mechanism of action, and potential in targeted cancer therapies. Herein, the total syntheses of tiancimycins A and B, yangpumicin A, and a number of related anthraquinone-fused enediynes are described. Biological evaluation of the synthesized compounds revealed extremely potent cytotoxicities against a number of cell lines, thus enriching the structure-activity relationships within this class of compounds. The findings of these studies may facilitate future investigations directed toward antibody-drug conjugates for targeted cancer therapies and provide inspiration for further advances in total synthesis and chemical biology.",2
Mechanistic Insights into Electroreductive C-C Coupling between CO and Acetaldehyde into Multicarbon Products.,"Production of valuable multicarbon (C3+) products through the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO2RR and CORR) is desirable; however, mechanistic understanding that enables C-C coupling beyond the self-coupling of CO to valuable products is lacking. In this work, we elucidate the C-C coupling mechanism between CO and acetaldehyde, a reactive intermediate in both CO2RR and CORR, via combined isotopic labeling and in situ spectroscopic investigations. CO attacks the carbonyl carbon of acetaldehyde in the coupling, and the carbon in CO ends up in the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) of the produced 1-propanol. While the coupling between CO and acetaldehyde does occur when the CORR is conducted with added acetaldehyde, only a minor fraction (up to 36%) of 1-propanol is from this pathway, and the majority of it is produced in the CORR by the self-coupling among CO. The adsorbed methylcarbonyl is proposed as the likely intermediate where the reaction pathway bifurcates to C2 and C3 products; i.e., it could either be hydrogenated to acetaldehyde and ethanol or couple with CO leading to the formation of 1-propanol.",2
"Entry to 1,2,3,4-Tetrasubstituted Arenes through Addressing the ""Meta Constraint"" in the Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis.","Arenes with four different contiguous substituents, i.e. 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted arenes, are commonly found in bioactive compounds, but they are nontrivial to access via conventional methods. Through addressing the ""meta constraint"" in the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, which is the difficulty of tolerating a sizable meta substituent in aryl halide substrates, here a modular and regioselective approach is realized for preparing 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted arenes. One key is the use of a C2-amide-substituted NBE, and a combined experimental and computational study reveals its role in promoting the NBE insertion and the ortho C-H metalation steps. The scope is broad: a variety of electrophiles and nucleophiles could be introduced to the ortho and ipso positions, respectively, with 1,4-disubstituted aryl halides, leading to diverse unsymmetrical contiguous tetrasubstituted arenes. Application of this approach has been demonstrated in streamlined syntheses of several bioactive compounds.",2
Narrow Band Gap Observed in a Molecular Ferroelastic: Ferrocenium Tetrachloroferrate.,"Due to the intriguing chemical variability and structure-property flexibility, molecular materials with striking multifunctional characteristics, including tunable physical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties, have aroused wide attention. Recently, great advances have also been made in designing molecular ferroelastics with optoelectronic properties. However, the band gaps of the most typical ferroelastics are far in excess of 2.0 eV, which severely hinder their further applications. And this corresponds to the inherent incompatibility of ferroelastics. Herein we report an organometallic compound, ferrocenium tetrachloroferrate (1), undergoing a ferroelastic phase transition at 407.7 K with a large spontaneous strain of 0.1088. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular ferroelastic with such a high Curie temperature (Tc) and narrow band gap of 1.61 eV. UV-vis absorption spectra and density-functional theory (DFT) calculation confirm this band gap. The band gap of 1 is determined by both the ferrocenium and the tetrachloroferrate components. The ideal semiconducting characteristic makes a breakthrough in the inherent incompatibility with ferroelastics. This will inspire an intriguing and further research in molecular ferroelastics with ideal semiconductor characteristics and hold great potential for the utilization in optoelectronic devices, especially the photovoltaic applications.",2
"Luminescence ""Turn-On"" Detection of Gossypol Using Ln(3+)-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks and Ln(3+) Salts.","Gossypol (Gsp), a natural toxin concentrated in cottonseeds, poses great risks to the safe consumption of cottonseed products, which are used extensively throughout the food industry. In this work, we report the first luminescence ""turn-on"" sensors for Gsp using near-infrared emitting lanthanide (Ln(3+)) materials, including Ln(3+) MOFs and Ln(3+) salts. We first demonstrate that the Yb(3+) photoluminescence of a Yb(3+) MOF, Yb-NH2-TPDC, can be employed to selectively detect Gsp with a limit of detection of 25 mug/mL via a ""turn-on"" response from a completely nonemissive state in the absence of Gsp. The recyclability and stability of Yb-NH2-TPDC in the presence of Gsp was demonstrated by fluorescence spectroscopy and PXRD analysis, respectively. A variety of background substances present in practical samples that would require Gsp sensing, such as refined cottonseed oil, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha-tocopherol, did not interfere with the Yb(3+) photoluminescence signal. We further identified that the ""turn-on"" of Yb-NH2-TPDC photoluminescence was due to the ""antenna effect"" of Gsp, as evidenced by spectroscopic studies and supported by computational analysis. This is the first report that Gsp can effectively sensitize Yb(3+) photoluminescence. Leveraging this sensing mechanism, we demonstrate facile, highly sensitive, fast-response detection of Gsp using YbCl3.6H2O and NdCl3.6H2O solutions. Overall, we show for the first time that Ln(3+)-based materials are promising luminescent sensors for Gsp detection. We envision that the reported sensing approach will be applicable to the detection of a wide variety of aromatic molecules using Ln(3+) compounds including MOFs, complexes, and salts.",2
A Lateral Salt Bridge for the Specific Assembly of an ABC-Type Collagen Heterotrimer.,"Nature uses salt bridges to control the folding and stability of many proteins, including collagen, the key structural protein in mammals. Here, we present an interstrand salt bridge between (4S)-aminoproline (Amp) and aspartic acid (Asp) that directs the composition and register-specific assembly of synthetic collagen heterotrimers. This Amp-Asp salt bridge allowed for the rational design of strands that fold into A2B and ABC-type heterotrimers with only three salt bridges per triple helix. Native ESI-MS and NMR spectroscopic analyses corroborated the specific assembly of the ABC heterotrimer.",2
Modular Total Synthesis in Reticular Chemistry.,"The idea of modularity in organic total synthesis has promoted the construction of diverse targeted natural products by varying the building blocks and assembly sequences. Yet its utilization has been mainly limited to the synthesis of molecular compounds based on covalent bonds. In this work, we expand the conceptual scope of modular synthesis into framework materials, which bridges metal- and covalent organic frameworks (MOFs and COFs) hierarchically in reticular chemistry. While the assembly sequences are determined by the coordination or the covalent bond strengths, a modular synthesis strategy which progressively links simple building blocks into increasingly sophisticated superstructures was reported. As a result, a series of hierarchical COF-on-MOF structures with architectural intricacy were obtained through sequence-defined reactions of diverse building blocks. The tunability of spatial apportionment, compositions, and functionality was successfully managed in these framework materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of COF@MOF composites and also the first discovery of controlled COF alignment. This generalizable modularity strategy will not only accelerate the discovery of multicomponent framework materials by the hierarchical assembly of MOFs and COFs but also offer a predictable retrosynthetic route to smart materials with unusual tunability owing to the diverse inorganic or organic building units.",2
Nickel/Photo-Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Acyl-Carbamoylation of Alkenes.,"An unprecedented asymmetric acyl-carbamoylation of pendant alkenes tethered on aryl carbamic chlorides with both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes has been developed via the cooperative catalysis of a chiral nickel-PHOX complex and tetrabutylammonium decatungstate. This reaction represents the first example of merging hydrogen-atom-transfer photochemistry and asymmetric transition metal catalysis in difunctionalization of alkenes. Using this protocol, a variety of oxindoles bearing a challenging quaternary stereogenic center are furnished under mild conditions in highly enantioselective manner.",2
Engineering a Highly Defective Stable UiO-66 with Tunable Lewis- Bronsted Acidity: The Role of the Hemilabile Linker.,"The stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) typically decreases with an increasing number of defects, limiting the number of defects that can be created and limiting catalytic and other applications. Herein, we use a hemilabile (Hl) linker to create up to a maximum of six defects per cluster in UiO-66. We synthesized hemilabile UiO-66 (Hl-UiO-66) using benzene dicarboxylate (BDC) as linker and 4-sulfonatobenzoate (PSBA) as the hemilabile linker. The PSBA acts not only as a modulator to create defects but also as a coligand that enhances the stability of the resulting defective framework. Furthermore, upon a postsynthetic treatment in H2SO4, the average number of defects increases to the optimum of six missing BDC linkers per cluster (three per formula unit), leaving the Zr-nodes on average sixfold coordinated. Remarkably, the thermal stability of the materials further increases upon this treatment. Periodic density functional theory calculations confirm that the hemilabile ligands strengthen this highly defective structure by several stabilizing interactions. Finally, the catalytic activity of the obtained materials is evaluated in the acid-catalyzed isomerization of alpha-pinene oxide. This reaction is particularly sensitive to the Bronsted or Lewis acid sites in the catalyst. In comparison to the pristine UiO-66, which mainly possesses Bronsted acid sites, the Hl-UiO-66 and the postsynthetically treated Hl-UiO-66 structures exhibited a higher Lewis acidity and an enhanced activity and selectivity. This is further explored by CD3CN spectroscopic sorption experiments. We have shown that by tuning the number of defects in UiO-66 using PSBA as the hemilabile linker, one can achieve highly defective and stable MOFs and easily control the Bronsted to Lewis acid ratio in the materials and thus their catalytic activity and selectivity.",2
Engineering Long-Range Order in Supramolecular Assemblies on Surfaces: The Paramount Role of Internal Double Bonds in Discrete Long-Chain Naphthalenediimides.,"Achieving long-range order with surface-supported supramolecular assemblies is one of the pressing challenges in the prospering field of non-covalent surface functionalization. Having access to defect-free on-surface molecular assemblies will pave the way for various nanotechnology applications. Here we report the synthesis of two libraries of naphthalenediimides (NDIs) symmetrically functionalized with long aliphatic chains (C28 and C33) and their self-assembly at the 1-phenyloctane/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (1-PO/HOPG) interface. The two NDI libraries differ by the presence/absence of an internal double bond in each aliphatic chain (unsaturated and saturated compounds, respectively). All molecules assemble into lamellar arrangements, with the NDI cores lying flat and forming 1D rows on the surface, while the carbon chains separate the 1D rows from each other. Importantly, the presence of the unsaturation plays a dominant role in the arrangement of the aliphatic chains, as it exclusively favors interdigitation. The fully saturated tails, instead, self-assemble into a combination of either interdigitated or non-interdigitated diagonal arrangements. This difference in packing is spectacularly amplified at the whole surface level and results in almost defect-free self-assembled monolayers for the unsaturated compounds. In contrast, the monolayers of the saturated counterparts are globally disordered, even though they locally preserve the lamellar arrangements. The experimental observations are supported by computational studies and are rationalized in terms of stronger van der Waals interactions in the case of the unsaturated compounds. Our investigation reveals the paramount role played by internal double bonds on the self-assembly of discrete large molecules at the liquid/solid interface.",2
High-Affinity Interactions of the nSH3/cSH3 Domains of Grb2 with the C-Terminal Proline-Rich Domain of SOS1.,"Grb2 is an adaptor protein that recruits Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Son of Sevenless 1 (SOS1), to the plasma membrane. SOS1 exchanges GDP by GTP, activating Ras. Grb2 consists of an SH2 domain flanked by N- and C-terminal SH3 domains (nSH3/cSH3). Grb2 nSH3/cSH3 domains have strong binding affinity for the SOS1 proline-rich (PR) domain that mediates the Grb2-SOS1 interaction. The nSH3/cSH3 domains have distinct preferred binding motifs: PxxPxR for nSH3 and PxxxRxxKP for cSH3 (x represents any natural amino acid). Several nSH3-binding motifs have been identified in the SOS1 PR domain but none specific for cSH3 binding. Even though both nSH3 and cSH3 exhibit the strongest binding to the SOS1 peptide PVPPPVPPRRRP, this mutually exclusive binding combined with other potential nSH3/cSH3 binding regions in SOS1 makes understanding the Grb2-SOS1 interaction challenging. To identify the SOS1-cSH3 binding sites, we selected seven potential binding segments in SOS1. The synthesized peptides were tested for their binding to nSH3/cSH3. Our NMR data reveal that the PKLPPKTYKREH peptide has strong binding affinity for cSH3, but very weak for nSH3. The binding specificity suggests that the most likely Grb2-SOS1 binding mode is through nSH3-PVPPPVPPRRRP and cSH3-PKLPPKTYKREH interactions, which is supported by replica-exchange simulations for the Grb2-SOS1 complex models. We propose that nSH3/cSH3 binding peptides, which effectively interrupt Grb2-SOS1 association, can serve as tumor suppressors. The Grb2-SOS1 mechanism outlined here offers new venues for future therapeutic strategies for upstream mutations in cancer, such as in EGFR.",2
Observation of the Imidazole-Imidazolium Hydrogen Bonds Responsible for Selective Proton Conductance in the Influenza A M2 Channel.,"The integral membrane M2 protein is a 97-residue membrane protein that assembles as a tetramer to conduct protons at a slow rate (10(2)-10(3)/s) when activated by low pH. The proton conductance mechanism has been extensively debated in the literature, but it is accepted that the proton conductance is facilitated by hydrogen bonds involving the His37 residues. However, the hydrogen bonding partnership remains unresolved. Here, we report on the measurement of (15)N-(15)N J-couplings of (15)N His37-labeled full length M2 (M2FL) protein from Influenza A virus embedded in synthetic liquid crystalline lipid bilayers using two-dimensional J-resolved NMR spectroscopy. We experimentally observed the hydrogen-bond mediated J-couplings between Ndelta1 and Nepsilon2 of adjacent His37 imidazole rings, providing direct evidence for the existence of various imidazolium-imidazole hydrogen-bonding geometries in the histidine tetrad at low pH, thus validating the proton conduction mechanism in the M2FL protein by which the proton is transferred through the breaking and reforming of the hydrogen bonds between pairs of His37 residues.",2
Imidazole-Imidazole Hydrogen Bonding in the pH-Sensing Histidine Side Chains of Influenza A M2.,"The arrangement of histidine side chains in influenza A M2 tetramer determines their pKa values, which define pH-controlled proton conduction critical to the virus lifecycle. Both water-associated and hydrogen-bonded imidazole-imidazolium histidine quaternary structures have been proposed, based on crystal structures and NMR chemical shifts, respectively. Here we show, using the conduction domain construct of M2 in lipid bilayers, that the imidazole rings are hydrogen bonded even at a pH of 7.8 in the neutral charge state. An intermolecular 8.9 +/- 0.3 Hz (2h)JNN hydrogen bond is observed between H37 Nepsilon and Ndelta recorded in a fully protonated sample with 100 kHz magic-angle spinning. This interaction could not be detected in the drug-bound sample.",2
Robust Metal-Triazolate Frameworks for CO2 Capture from Flue Gas.,"Construction of thermally and chemically robust metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is highly desirable for postcombustion CO2 capture from flue gas containing water vapor and other acidic gases. Here we report a strategy based on appending amino groups to the triazolate linkers of MOFs to achieve exceptional chemical stability against aqueous, acidic, and basic conditions. These MOFs exhibit not only CO2/N2 thermodynamic adsorption selectivity as high as 120 but also CO2/H2O kinetic adsorption selectivity up to 70, featuring distinct adsorptive sites at the channel center for CO2 and at the corner for H2O, respectively. The best performing MOF in this series features low regeneration energy, high CO2 capture utility under humid conditions, and decent cycling performance for mimic flue gas.",2
Tip-To-Middle Anisotropic MOF-On-MOF Growth with a Structural Adjustment.,"Well-organized construction of hybrid metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with complicated structures or components is a great importance because of their potential usefulness. In this regard, the conjugation of more than two MOFs, which have dissimilar components and/or structures, is a smart strategy for the production of hybrid MOFs. MOF-on-MOF growth is fundamental for the conjugation of two MOFs and should be deeply understood for the finely controlled conjugation and for the formation of well-organized hybrid MOFs. Herein, we report an interesting MOF growth process for the construction of hybrid MOF particles containing heterogeneous components and cell lattices. Interestingly, even though a newly grown MOF and an MOF template have mismatched cell lattices, the anisotropic growth results in unexpectedly well-defined core-shell-type hybrid MOFs. Comprehensive monitoring of the growth process revealed a tip-to-middle MOF-on-MOF growth, which elucidates the uncommon formation of a well-defined core-shell hybrid despite the anisotropic growth. A tip-to-middle anisotropic growth process is accompanied by self-adjustment of MOF cell lattices to anchor on the template surface having mismatched cell lattices in the early reaction stage and self-reversion of cell lattices to the original comfortable configuration in the middle stage of the reaction.",2
Molecular Insight into Fluorocarbon Adsorption in Pore Expanded Metal-Organic Framework Analogs.,"The rapid growth in the global energy demand for space cooling requires the development of more efficient environmental chillers for which adsorption-based cooling systems can be utilized. Here, in this contribution, we explore sorbents for chiller use via a pore-engineering concept to construct analogs of the 1-dimensional pore metal-organic framework MOF-74 by using elongated organic linkers and stereochemistry control. The prepared pore-engineered MOFs show remarkable equilibrium adsorption of the selected fluorocarbon refrigerant that is translated to a modeled adsorption-based refrigeration cycle. To probe molecular level interactions at the origin of these unique adsorption properties for this series of Ni-MOFs, we combined in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared techniques, and molecular simulations. Our results reveal the coordination of fluorine (of CH2F in R134a) to the nickel(II) open metal centers at low pressures for each Ni-MOF analog and provide insight into the pore filling mechanism for the full range of the adsorption isotherms. The newly designed Ni-TPM demonstrates exceptional R134a adsorption uptake compared to its parent microporous Ni-MOF-74 due to larger engineered pore size/volume. The application of this adsorption performance toward established chiller conditions yields a working capacity increase for Ni-TPM of about 400% from that of Ni-MOF-74, which combined with kinetics directly correlates to both a higher coefficient of performance and a higher average cooling capacity generated in a modeled chiller.",2
Engineering of Upconverted Metal-Organic Frameworks for Near-Infrared Light-Triggered Combinational Photodynamic/Chemo-/Immunotherapy against Hypoxic Tumors.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great potential as nanophotosensitizers (nPSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The use of such MOFs in PDT, however, is limited by the shallow depth of tissue penetration of short-wavelength light and the oxygen-dependent mechanism that renders it inadequate for hypoxic tumors. Here, to combat such limitations, we rationally designed core-shell upconversion nanoparticle@porphyrinic MOFs (UCSs) for combinational therapy against hypoxic tumors. The UCSs were synthesized in high yield through the conditional surface engineering of UCNPs and subsequent seed-mediated growth strategy. The heterostructure allows efficient energy transfer from the UCNP core to the MOF shell, which enables the near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. A hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) was encapsulated in nanopores of the MOF shell of the heterostructures to yield the final construct TPZ/UCSs. We demonstrated that TPZ/UCSs represent a promising system for achieving improved cancer treatment in vitro and in vivo via the combination of NIR light-induced PDT and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy. Furthermore, the integration of the nanoplatform with antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (alpha-PD-L1) treatment promotes the abscopal effect to completely inhibit the growth of untreated distant tumors by generating specific tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, this work highlights a robust nanoplatform for combining NIR light-triggered PDT and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy with immunotherapy to combat the current limitations of tumor treatment.",2
Separation of Benzene and Cyclohexane by Nonporous Adaptive Crystals of a Hybrid[3]arene.,"The separation of benzene and cyclohexane is one of the most challenging tasks in the petrochemical field. However, conventional separation methods suffer from cumbersome operation, huge energy expenditure, or use of entrainers. Herein, we develop an environmentally friendly and energy saving adsorptive separation strategy using nonporous adaptive crystals of a hybrid[3]arene (1). Adaptive 1 crystals separate benzene from an equimolar benzene/cyclohexane mixture with a purity of 97.5%. The selectivity comes from the stability and variability of the new crystal structure upon capture of the preferred guest, benzene. Moreover, reversible transformations between the nonporous guest-free structure and the guest-containing structure make 1 highly recyclable.",2
Protecting-Group-Free Syntheses of ent-Kaurane Diterpenoids: [3+2+1] Cycloaddition/Cycloalkenylation Approach.,"The Yu's Rh-catalyzed [3+2+1] cycloaddition followed by a Pd-mediated 5-endo cycloalkenylation is shown to be a general and powerful approach for efficient construction of the tetracyclic core structure of ent-kaurane diterpenoids. The utility of this strategy was further demonstrated by concise and protecting-group-free total syntheses of ent-1alpha-hydroxykauran-12-one, 12-oxo-9,11-dehydrokaurene, and 12alpha-hydroxy-9,11-dehydrokaurene.",2
In Situ Genetically Cascaded Amplification for Imaging RNA Subcellular Locations.,"In situ amplification methods, such as hybridization chain reaction, are valuable tools for mapping the spatial distribution and subcellular location of target analytes. However, the live-cell applications of these methods are still limited due to challenges in the probe delivery, degradation, and cytotoxicity. Herein, we report a novel genetically encoded in situ amplification method to noninvasively image the subcellular location of RNA targets in living cells. In our system, a fluorogenic RNA reporter, Broccoli, was split into two nonfluorescent fragments and conjugated to the end of two RNA hairpin strands. The binding of one target RNA can then trigger a cascaded hybridization between these hairpin pairs and thus activate multiple Broccoli fluorescence signals. We have shown that such an in situ amplified strategy can be used for the sensitive detection and location imaging of various RNA targets in living bacterial and mammalian cells. This new design principle provides an effective and versatile platform for tracking various intracellular analytes.",2
"Chemo- and Regioselective Synthesis of Acyl-Cyclohexenes by a Tandem Acceptorless Dehydrogenation-[1,5]-Hydride Shift Cascade.","An atom-economical methodology to access substituted acyl-cyclohexenes from pentamethylacetophenone and 1,5-diols is described. This process is catalyzed by an iridium(I) catalyst in conjunction with a bulky electron rich phosphine ligand (CataCXium A) which favors acceptorless dehydrogenation over conjugate reduction to the corresponding cyclohexane. The reaction produces water and hydrogen gas as the sole byproducts and a wide range of functionalized acyl-cyclohexene products can be synthesized using this method in very high yields. A series of control experiments were carried out, which revealed that the process is initiated by acceptorless dehydrogenation of the diol followed by a redox-neutral cascade process, which is independent of the iridium catalyst. Deuterium labeling studies established that the key step of this cascade involves a novel base-mediated [1,5]-hydride shift. The cyclohexenyl ketone products could readily be cleaved under mildly acidic conditions to access a range of valuable substituted cyclohexene derivatives.",2
Elucidating Surface Structure with Action Spectroscopy.,"Surface Action Spectroscopy, a vibrational spectroscopy method developed in recent years at the Fritz Haber Institute is employed for structure determination of clean and H2O-dosed (111) magnetite surfaces. Surface structural information is revealed by using the microscopic surface vibrations as a fingerprint of the surface structure. Such vibrations involve just the topmost atomic layers, and therefore the structural information is truly surface related. Our results strongly support the view that regular Fe3O4(111)/Pt(111) is terminated by the so-called Fetet1 termination, that the biphase termination of Fe3O4(111)/Pt(111) consists of FeO and Fe3O4(111) terminated areas, and we show that the method can differentiate between different water structures in H2O-derived adsorbate layers on Fe3O4(111)/Pt(111). With this, we conclude that the method is a capable new member in the set of techniques providing crucial information to elucidate surface structures. The method does not rely on translational symmetry and can therefore also be applied to systems which are not well ordered. Even an application to rough surfaces is possible.",2
Colossal Negative Linear Compressibility in Porous Organic Salts.,"Negative linear compressibility (NLC) is a common sense violation (that is, crystal phases expand in one or more directions under hydrostatic compression). The excellent NLC performance of crystal materials is intrinsically related to the geometric structure of its skeleton. Here, we discovered a crystalline porous organic salt (CPOS-1); high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments reveal that the CPOS-1 shows colossal NLC (Kc = -90.7 T Pa(-1)) behavior along the c axis. This incredible performance arises from the flexible ""supramolecular spring"" formed by the charge-enhanced N-H(+)...(-)O-S hydrogen bond interaction between the anionic sulfonate and the cationic ammonium ion. Furthermore, we reveal the relationship between this rare NLC behavior and single crystal proton conductivity using high-pressure electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. We believe that NLC behavior research on such inexpensive and readily available porous organic materials is of great significance for accelerating the research and application of NLC materials, especially in organic system.",2
High-Pressure Synthesis of Magnetic Neodymium Polyhydrides.,"Ongoing search for room-temperature superconductivity is inspired by the unique properties of the electron-phonon interaction in metal superhydrides. Encouraged by the recently found highest-TC superconductor fcc-LaH10, here we discover several superhydrides of another lanthanoid, neodymium. We identify three novel metallic Nd-H phases at pressures ranging from 85 to 135 GPa: I4/mmm-NdH4, C2/c-NdH7, and P63/mmc-NdH9, synthesized by laser-heating metal samples in NH3BH3 media for in situ generation of hydrogen. A lower trihydride Fm3m-NdH3 is found at pressures from 2 to 52 GPa. I4/mmm-NdH4 and C2/c-NdH7 are stable from 135 to 85 GPa, and P63/mmc-NdH9 is stable from 110 to 130 GPa. Measurements of the electrical resistance of NdH9 demonstrate a possible superconducting transition at approximately 4.5 K in P63/mmc-NdH9. Our theoretical calculations predict that all of the neodymium hydrides have antiferromagnetic order at pressures below 150 GPa and represent one of the first discovered examples of strongly correlated superhydrides with large exchange spin-splitting in the electronic band structure (>450 meV). The critical Neel temperatures for new neodymium hydrides are estimated using the mean-field approximation to be about 4 K (NdH4), 251 K (NdH7), and 136 K (NdH9).",2
Incorporation of Cr(III) into a Keggin Polyoxometalate as a Chemical Strategy to Stabilize a Labile {Cr(III)O4} Tetrahedral Conformation and Promote Unattended Single-Ion Magnet Properties.,"Polyoxometalates (POMs) provide rigid and highly symmetric coordination sites and can be used as a strategy for the stabilization of magnetic ions. Herein, we report a new member of the Keggin archetype, the Cr-centered Keggin anion [alpha-CrW12O40](5-) (CrW12), with the unusual tetrahedral coordination of Cr(III) reported for the first time in POMs conferring unattended magnetic properties. POM chemistry has recently presented excellent examples of single-molecule and single-ion magnets (SMMs and SIMs) as well as molecular spin qubits; however, the majority of POM-based SIMs reported to date contain lanthanoid ions. CrW12, as the first example of a chromium(III) SIM, exhibits slow relaxation of magnetization and quantum tunneling with a single-ion magnetic behavior even above 10 K with an energy barrier for the reversal of the magnetization of 3.0 K. The first 3d-metal SIM based on a nonlacunary Keggin anion is the foundation for a new research area in POM chemistry.",2
Intermolecular Palladium(0)-Catalyzed Atropo-enantioselective C-H Arylation of Heteroarenes.,"Atropisomeric (hetero)biaryls are motifs with increasing significance in ligands, natural products, and biologically active molecules. The straightforward construction of the stereogenic axis by efficient C-H functionalization methods is extremely rare and challenging. An intermolecular and highly enantioselective C-H arylation of relevant heteroarenes providing an efficient access to atropisomeric (hetero)biaryls is reported. The use of a Pd(0) complex equipped with H8-BINAPO as a chiral ligand enables the direct functionalization of a broad range of 1,2,3-triazoles and pyrazoles in excellent yields and selectivities of up to 97.5:2.5 er. The method also allows for an atroposelective double C-H arylation for the construction of two stereogenic axes with >99.5:0.5 er.",2
Oxygen Tolerant and Cytocompatible Iron(0)-Mediated ATRP Enables the Controlled Growth of Polymer Brushes from Mammalian Cell Cultures.,"The use of zerovalent iron (Fe(0))-coated plates, which act both as a source of catalyst and as a reducing agent during surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), enables the controlled growth of a wide range of polymer brushes under ambient conditions utilizing either organic or aqueous reaction media. Thanks to its cytocompatibility, Fe(0) SI-ATRP can be applied within cell cultures, providing a tool that can broadly and dynamically modify the substrate's affinity toward cells, without influencing their viability. Upon systematically assessing the application of Fe-based catalytic systems in the controlled grafting of polymers, Fe(0) SI-ATRP emerges as an extremely versatile technique that could be applied to tune the physicochemical properties of a cell's microenvironments on biomaterials or within tissue engineering constructs.",2
High Efficiency Mesoscopic Solar Cells Using CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dots Enabled by Chemical Interface Engineering.,"All-inorganic alpha-CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are attracting great interest as solar cell absorbers due to their appealing light harvesting properties and enhanced stability due to the absence of volatile organic constituents. Moreover, ex situ synthesized QDs significantly reduce the variability of the perovskite layer deposition process. However, the incorporation of alpha-CsPbI3 QDs into mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) is highly challenging, but these constitute the best performing electron transport materials in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells. Herein, the m-TiO2 surface is engineered using an electron-rich cesium-ion containing methyl acetate solution. As one effect of this treatment, the solid-liquid interfacial tension at the TiO2 surface is reduced and the wettability is improved, facilitating the migration of the QDs into m-TiO2. As a second effect, Cs(+) ions passivate the QD surface and promote the charge transfer at the m-TiO2/QD interface, leading to an enhancement of the electron injection rate by a factor of 3. In combination with an ethanol-environment smoothing route that significantly reduces the surface roughness of the m-TiO2/QD layer, optimized devices exhibit highly reproducible power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13%. The best cell with an efficiency of 14.32% (reverse scan) reaches a short-circuit current density of 17.77 mA cm(-2), which is an outstanding value for QD-based perovskite solar cells.",2
CO2 Photoreduction on Metal Oxide Surface Is Driven by Transient Capture of Hot Electrons: Ab Initio Quantum Dynamics Simulation.,"The most critical bottleneck in CO2 photoreduction lies in the activation of CO2 to form an anion radical, CO2(*-), or other intermediates by the photoexcited electrons, because CO2 has a high-energy lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Taking rutile TiO2(110) as a prototypical surface, we use time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that the excitation of bending and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of CO2 can sufficiently stabilize the CO2 LUMO below the conduction band minimum, allowing it to trap photoexcited hot electrons and get reduced. Such vibrational excitations occur by formation of a transient CO2(*-) adsorbed in an oxygen vacancy. CO2 can trap the hot electrons for nearly 100 fs and dissociate to form CO within 30-40 fs after the trapping. We propose that the activation of the CO2 bending and antisymmetric stretching vibrations driven by hot electrons applies to other CO2 reduction photocatalysts and can be realized by different techniques and material design.",2
Synergy between Ion Migration and Charge Carrier Recombination in Metal-Halide Perovskites.,"Charge carrier recombination plays a vital role in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell. By investigating a possible synergy between ion migration and charge carrier recombination, we demonstrate that the nonradiative recombination accelerates by an order of magnitude during iodide migration. The migration induces lattice distortion that brings electrons and holes close to each other and increases their electrostatic interactions. The wave function localization in the same spatial region, and the enhanced lattice and iodide movements increase the nonadiabatic coupling. At the same time, quantum coherence lasts longer, because electron and hole energy levels become correlated. All these factors greatly increase the recombination rate. Moreover, the energy level of the iodide vacancy created during the migration moves from inside the conduction band in the equilibrated structure into the band gap, acting as a typical efficient nonradiative charge recombination center. Our work shows that the different dynamic processes are strongly correlated in halide perovskites and demonstrates that defects, considered to be benign, can become very detrimental under non-equilibrium conditions. The reported results strongly suggest that ion migration should be avoided in halide perovskites, both for its own reasons, such as the large current-voltage hysteresis, and because it greatly accelerates charge carrier losses.",2
Short-Wave Infrared Quantum Dots with Compact Sizes as Molecular Probes for Fluorescence Microscopy.,"Materials with short-wave infrared (SWIR) emission are promising contrast agents for in vivo animal imaging, providing high-contrast and high-resolution images of blood vessels in deep tissues. However, SWIR emitters have not been developed as molecular labels for microscopy applications in the life sciences, which require optimized probes that are bright, stable, and small. Here, we design and synthesize semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with SWIR emission based on HgxCd1-xSe alloy cores red shifted to the SWIR by epitaxial deposition of thin HgxCd1-xS shells with a small band gap. By tuning alloy composition alone, the emission can be shifted across the visible-to-SWIR (VIR) spectra while maintaining a small and equal size, allowing direct comparisons of molecular labeling performance across a broad range of wavelength. After coating with click-functional multidentate polymers, the VIR-QD spectral series has high quantum yield in the SWIR (14-33%), compact size (13 nm hydrodynamic diameter), and long-term stability in aqueous media during continuous excitation. We show that these properties enable diverse applications of SWIR molecular probes for fluorescence microscopy using conjugates of antibodies, growth factors, and nucleic acids. A broadly useful outcome is a 10-55-fold enhancement of the signal-to-background ratio at both the single-molecule level and the ensemble level in the SWIR relative to visible wavelengths, primarily due to drastically reduced autofluorescence. We anticipate that VIR-QDs with SWIR emission will enable ultrasensitive molecular imaging of low-copy number analytes in biospecimens with high autofluorescence.",2
Charge Inversion and Calcium Gating in Mixtures of Ions in Nanopores.,"Calcium ions play important roles in many physiological processes, yet their concentration is much lower than the concentrations of potassium and sodium ions. The selectivity of calcium channels is often probed in mixtures of calcium and a monovalent salt, e.g., KCl or NaCl, prepared such that the concentration of cations is kept constant with the mole fraction of calcium varying from 0 and 1. In biological channels, even sub-mM concentration of calcium can modulate the channels' transport characteristics; this effect is often explained via the existence of high affinity Ca(2+) binding sites on the channel walls. Inspired by properties of biological calcium-selective channels, we prepared a set of nanopores with tunable opening diameters that exhibited a similar response to the presence of calcium ions as biochannels. Nanopores in 15 nm thick silicon nitride films were drilled using focused ion beam and e-beam in a transmission electron microscope and subsequently rendered negatively charged through silanization. We found that nanopores with diameters smaller than 20 nm were blocked by calcium ions such that the ion currents in mixtures of KCl and CaCl2 and in CaCl2 were even ten times smaller than the ion currents in KCl solution. The ion current blockage was explained by the effect of local charge inversion where accumulated calcium ions switch the effective surface charge from negative to positive. The modulation of surface charge with calcium leads to concentration and voltage dependent local charge density and ion current. The combined experimental and modeling results provide a link between calcium ion-induced changes in surface charge properties and resulting ionic transport.",2
Phase Separation in Atomistic Simulations of Model Membranes.,"Understanding the lateral organization in plasma membranes remains an open problem despite a large body of research. Model membranes with coexisting micrometer-size domains are routinely employed as simplified models of plasma membranes. Many molecular dynamics simulations have investigated phase separation in model membranes at the coarse-grained level, but atomistic simulations remain computationally challenging. We simulate DPPC:DOPC and DPPC:DOPC:cholesterol lipid bilayers to investigate phase transitions at temperatures from 310 to 270 K. In this temperature range, the binary mixture forms a liquid phase (Lalpha) and a coexistence of Lalpha and either gel or ripple phases. The ternary mixture forms a liquid disordered (Ld) phase and a coexistence of liquid ordered (Lo) and either Ld or gel phases. We quantify the coexisting phases and discuss their properties against the background of experimental results. We observe partial registration of growing domains in both mixtures. We characterize specific cholesterol-cholesterol and cholesterol-phospholipid interaction geometries underlying its increased partitioning and the smoothed phase transition in the ternary mixture compared to the binary mixture. By comparing coexisting domains with homogeneous bilayers of the same composition, we demonstrate how domain coexistence affects their properties. Our simulations provide important insights into the lipid-lipid interactions in model lipid bilayers and improve our understanding of the lateral organization in plasma membranes with higher compositional complexity.",2
Controlled Growth of 3R Phase Tantalum Diselenide and Its Enhanced Superconductivity.,"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have become a playground for exploring rich physical phenomena like superconductivity and charge-density-waves (CDW). Here, we report the synthesis of the atom-thin TaSe2 with a rare 3R phase and enhanced superconductivity. The 3R phase is achieved by an ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy and confirmed by the high-resolution aberration-corrected STEM. Low-temperature transport data reveal an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 1.6 K in the 3R-TaSe2, which undoubtedly breaks the traditional perception of TaSe2 crystal as a material with Tc close to 0 K. This work demonstrates the strength of ambient pressure CVD in the exploration of crystal polymorphism, highlights a decisive role of layer stacking order in the superconducting transition, and provides fresh insights on manipulating crystal structures to gain access to enhanced Tc.",2
The Chemical Design Principles for Axis-Dependent Conduction Polarity.,"The recent discovery that specific materials can simultaneously exhibit n-type conduction and p-type conduction along different directions of the single crystal has the potential to impact a broad range of electronic and energy-harvesting technologies. Here, we establish the chemical design principles for creating materials with this behavior. First, we define the single-carrier and multicarrier mechanisms for axis-dependent conduction polarity and their identifying band structure fingerprints. We show using first-principles predictions that the AMX (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M = Cu, Ag, Au; X = P, As, Sb) compounds consisting of MX honeycomb layers separated by A cations can exhibit p-type conduction in-plane and n-type conduction cross-plane via either mechanism depending on the doping level. We build up the band structure of BaCuAs using a molecular orbital approach to illustrate the structural origins of the two different mechanisms for axis-dependent conduction polarity. In total, this work shows this phenomenon can be quite prevalent in layered materials and reveals how to identify prospective materials.",2
Nanoarchitecture through Strained Molecules: Cubane-Derived Scaffolds and the Smallest Carbon Nanothreads.,"Relative to the rich library of small-molecule organics, few examples of ordered extended (i.e., nonmolecular) hydrocarbon networks are known. In particular, sp(3) bonded, diamond-like materials represent appealing targets because of their desirable mechanical, thermal, and optical properties. While many covalent organic frameworks (COFs)-extended, covalently bonded, and porous structures-have been realized through molecular architecture with exceptional control, the design and synthesis of dense, covalent extended solids has been a longstanding challenge. Here we report the preparation of a sp(3)-bonded, low-dimensional hydrocarbon synthesized via high-pressure, solid-state diradical polymerization of cubane (C8H8), which is a saturated, but immensely strained, cage-like molecule. Experimental measurements show that the obtained product is crystalline with three-dimensional order that appears to largely preserve the basic structural topology of the cubane molecular precursor and exhibits high hardness (comparable to fused quartz) and thermal stability up to 300 degrees C. Among the plausible theoretical candidate structures, one-dimensional carbon scaffolds comprising six- and four-membered rings that pack within a pseudosquare lattice provide the best agreement with experimental data. These diamond-like molecular rods with extraordinarily small thickness are among the smallest members in the carbon nanothread family, and calculations indicate one of the stiffest one-dimensional systems known. These results present opportunities for the synthesis of purely sp(3)-bonded extended solids formed through the strain release of saturated molecules, as opposed to only unsaturated precursors.",2
Selection of Aptamers with Large Hydrophobic 2'-Substituents.,"Previously, we evolved a DNA polymerase, SFM4-3, for the recognition of substrates modified at their 2' positions with a fluoro, O-methyl, or azido substituent. Here we use SFM4-3 to synthesize 2'-azido-modified DNA; we then use the azido group to attach different, large hydrophobic groups via click chemistry. We show that SFM4-3 recognizes the modified templates under standard conditions, producing natural DNA and thereby allowing amplification. To demonstrate the utility of this remarkable property, we use SFM4-3 to select aptamers with large hydrophobic 2' substituents that bind human neutrophil elastase or the blood coagulation protein factor IXa. The results indicate that SFM4-3 should facilitate the discovery of aptamers that adopt novel and perhaps more protein-like folds with hydrophobic cores that in turn allow them to access novel activities.",2
Rhodacyclopentanones as Linchpins for the Atom Economical Assembly of Diverse Polyheterocycles.,"We outline a conceptual blueprint that provides direct and atom economical access to a wide range of complex polyheterocycles. Our method capitalizes on the ambiphilic reactivity of rhodacyclopentanones that arise upon exposure of cyclopropanes to Rh(I) catalysts and CO. Using this approach, a wide array of polycyclizations are achieved, including variants that involve powerful dearomatizations and medium ring formations.",2
Genome Mining Reveals High Topological Diversity of omega-Ester-Containing Peptides and Divergent Evolution of ATP-Grasp Macrocyclases.,"omega-Ester-containing peptides (OEPs) are a family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) containing intramolecular omega-ester or omega-amide bonds. Although their distinct side-to-side connections may create considerable topological diversity of multicyclic peptides, it is largely unknown how diverse ring patterns have been developed in nature. Here, using genome mining of biosynthetic enzymes of OEPs, we identified genes encoding nine new groups of putative OEPs with novel core consensus sequences, disclosing a total of approximately 1500 candidate OEPs in 12 groups. Connectivity analysis revealed that OEPs from three different groups contain novel tricyclic structures, one of which has a distinct biosynthetic pathway where a single ATP-grasp enzyme produces both omega-ester and omega-amide linkages. Analysis of the enzyme cross-reactivity showed that, while enzymes are promiscuous to nonconserved regions of the core peptide, they have high specificity to the cognate core consensus sequence, suggesting that the enzyme-core pair has coevolved to create a unique ring topology within the same group and has sufficiently diversified across different groups. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the diverse ring topologies, in addition to diverse sequences, have been developed in nature with multiple omega-ester or omega-amide linkages in the OEP family of RiPPs.",2
Facet-Independent Oxygen Evolution Activity of Pure beta-NiOOH: Different Chemistries Leading to Similar Overpotentials.,"beta-Nickel oxyhydroxide (beta-NiOOH) is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the more difficult half-reaction involved in water splitting. In this study, we revisit the OER activities of the two most abundant crystallographic facets of pristine beta-NiOOH, the (0001) and (1010) facets, which expose 6-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated and 5-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated Ni sites, respectively. To this end, we model various active sites on these two facets using hybrid density functional theory, which includes a fraction of the exact nonlocal Fock exchange in the electronic description of the system. By evaluating thermodynamic OER overpotentials, we show that the two active sites considered on each crystallographic facet demonstrate OER activities remarkably different from each other. However, the lowest OER overpotentials calculated for the two facets were found to be similar to each other and comparable to the overpotential for the 4-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated Ni site on the (1211) facet of beta-NiOOH previously examined in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019 , 141 , 1 , 693 - 705 . This finding shows that all of the low-index facets investigated so far could be responsible for the experimentally observed OER activity of pristine beta-NiOOH. However, the lowest overpotential active sites on these three crystallographic facets operate via different mechanisms, underscoring the importance of considering multiple OER pathways and intermediates on each crystallographic facet of a potential electrocatalyst. Specifically, our work demonstrates that consideration of previously overlooked active sites, transition-metal-ion oxidation states, reaction intermediates, and lattice-oxygen-stabilization are critical to reveal the lowest overpotential OER pathways on pristine beta-NiOOH.",2
Gas-Phase Formation of Fulvenallene (C7H6) via the Jahn-Teller Distorted Tropyl (C7H7) Radical Intermediate under Single-Collision Conditions.,"The fulvenallene molecule (C7H6) has been synthesized via the elementary gas-phase reaction of the methylidyne radical (CH) with the benzene molecule (C6H6) on the doublet C7H7 surface under single collision conditions. The barrier-less route to the cyclic fulvenallene molecule involves the addition of the methylidyne radical to the pi-electron density of benzene leading eventually to a Jahn-Teller distorted tropyl (C7H7) radical intermediate and exotic ring opening-ring contraction sequences terminated by atomic hydrogen elimination. The methylidyne-benzene system represents a benchmark to probe the outcome of the elementary reaction of the simplest hydrocarbon radical-methylidyne-with the prototype of a closed-shell aromatic molecule-benzene-yielding nonbenzenoid fulvenallene. Combined with electronic structure and statistical calculations, this bimolecular reaction sheds light on the unusual reaction dynamics of Huckel aromatic systems and remarkable (polycyclic) reaction intermediates, which cannot be studied via classical organic, synthetic methods, thus opening up a versatile path to access this previously largely obscure class of fulvenallenes.",2
Dual Chalcogen-Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis.,"The noncovalent S...O bonding interaction is an evolutionary force that has been smartly exploited by nature to modulate the conformational preferences of proteins. The employment of this type of weak noncovalent force to drive chemical reactions is promising yet remains largely elusive. Herein, we describe a dual chalcogen-chalcogen bonding catalysis strategy that the distinct chalcogen atoms simultaneously interact with two chalcogen-based electron donors to give rise to the catalytic activity, thus facilitating chemical reactions. Conventional approaches to the Rauhut-Currier-type reactions require the use of strongly nucleophilic Lewis bases as essential promoters. The implementation of this dual chalcogen-chalcogen bonding catalysis strategy allows the simultaneous Se...O bonding interaction between chalcogen-bonding donors and an enone and an alcohol, enabling the realization of the Rauhut-Currier-type reactions in a distinct way. The further implementation of a consecutive dual Se...O bonding catalysis approach enables the achievement of an initial Rauhut-Currier-type reaction to give an enone product which further undergoes an alcohol-addition induced cyclization reaction. This work demonstrates that the nearly linear chalcogen-bonding interaction can differentiate similar alkyl groups to give rise to regioselectivity. Moreover, the new strategy shows its advantage as it not only enables less reactive substrates working efficiently but tolerates inaccessible substrates using conventional methods.",2
Direct Evidence in the Scattering Function for the Coexistence of Two Types of Local Structures in Liquid Water.,"Water is the essential liquid on earth since it not only plays vital roles in living systems but also has a significant impact on our daily life from various industrial applications to earth's climate system. However, the unusual properties of liquid water, if compared with other liquids, has puzzled us for centuries because the basic structure of liquid water has remained unclear and has continued to be a matter of serious debate. Here, by computer simulations of three popular water models and the analysis of recent scattering experimental data, we show that there are two overlapped peaks hidden in the apparent ""first diffraction peak"" of the structure factor. One of them (ordinary peak) corresponds to the neighboring O-O distance as in ordinary liquids, and the other (anomalous peak) corresponds to a longer distance. We reveal that this anomalous peak arises from the most extended period of density wave associated with a tetrahedral water structure and is to be identified as the so-called first sharp diffraction peak that is commonly observed in silica and other tetrahedral liquids. In contrast, the ordinary peak arises from the density wave characteristic of local structures lacking tetrahedral symmetry. This finding unambiguously proves the coexistence of two types of local structures in liquid water. Our findings not only provide vital clues to settle a long-standing controversy on the water structure but also allow direct experimental access to the fraction of tetrahedral structures in liquid water.",2
Harnessing Applied Potential: Selective beta-Hydrocarboxylation of Substituted Olefins.,"The construction of carboxylic acid compounds in a selective fashion from low value materials such as alkenes remains a long-standing challenge to synthetic chemists. In particular, beta-addition to styrenes is underdeveloped. Herein we report a new electrosynthetic approach to the selective hydrocarboxylation of alkenes that overcomes the limitations of current transition metal and photochemical approaches. The reported method allows unprecedented direct access to carboxylic acids derived from beta,beta-trisubstituted alkenes, in a highly regioselective manner.",2
Global aromaticity at the nanoscale.,"Aromaticity can be defined by the ability of a molecule to sustain a ring current when placed in a magnetic field. Huckel's rule states that molecular rings with [4n + 2] pi-electrons are aromatic, with an induced magnetization that opposes the external field inside the ring, whereas those with 4n pi-electrons are antiaromatic, with the opposite magnetization. This rule reliably predicts the behaviour of small molecules, typically with fewer than 22 pi-electrons (n = 5). It is not clear whether aromaticity has a size limit, or whether Huckel's rule extends to much larger macrocycles. Here, we present evidence for global aromaticity in porphyrin nanorings with circuits of up to 162 pi-electrons (n = 40); aromaticity is controlled by changing the constitution, oxidation state and conformation. Whenever a ring current is observed, its direction is correctly predicted by Huckel's rule. The largest ring currents occur when the porphyrin units have fractional oxidation states.",2
Merging chemoenzymatic and radical-based retrosynthetic logic for rapid and modular synthesis of oxidized meroterpenoids.,"Meroterpenoids are natural products of hybrid biosynthetic origins-derived from both terpenoid and polyketide pathways-with a wealth of biological activities. Given their therapeutic potential, a general strategy to access these natural products in a concise and divergent fashion is highly desirable. Here, we report a modular synthesis of a suite of oxidized meroterpenoids using a hybrid synthetic strategy that is designed to harness the power of both biocatalytic and radical-based retrosynthetic logic. This strategy enables direct introduction of key hydroxyl groups and rapid construction of key bonds and stereocentres, facilitating the development of a concise route (7-12 steps from commercial materials) to eight oxidized meroterpenoids from two common molecular scaffolds. This work lays the foundation for rapid access to a wide range of oxidized meroterpenoids through the use of similar hybrid strategy that combines two synthetic approaches.",2
Single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalyst for the production of dihydrogen using low-energy light.,"Single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalysts for the conversion and storage of solar energy into chemical bonds are rare, inefficient and do not use significant portions of the visible spectrum. Here we show a new, air-stable bimetallic scaffold that acts as a single-chromophore photocatalyst for hydrogen-gas generation and operates with irradiation wavelengths that span the ultraviolet to the red/near-infrared. Irradiation in acidic solutions that contain an electron donor results in the catalytic production of hydrogen with 170 +/- 5 turnovers in 24 hours and an initial rate of 28 turnovers per hour. The catalysis proceeds through two stepwise excited-state redox events-atypical of the currently known homogeneous photocatalysis-and features the storage of multiple redox equivalents on a dirhodium catalyst enabled by low-energy light.",2
3D global aromaticity in a fully conjugated diradicaloid cage at different oxidation states.,"Aromaticity is a vital concept that governs the electronic properties of pi-conjugated organic molecules and has long been restricted to 2D systems. The aromaticity in 3D pi-conjugated molecules has been rarely studied. Here we report a fully conjugated diradicaloid molecular cage and its global aromaticity at different oxidation states. The neutral compound has an open-shell singlet ground state with a dominant 38pi monocyclic conjugation pathway and follows the [4n + 2] Huckel aromaticity rule; the dication has a triplet ground state with a dominant 36pi monocyclic conjugation pathway and satisfies [4n] Baird aromaticity; the tetracation is an open-shell singlet with 52 pi-electrons that are delocalized along the 3D rigid framework, showing 3D global antiaromaticity; and the hexacation possesses D3 symmetry with 50 globally delocalized pi-electrons, showing [6n + 2] 3D global aromaticity. Different types of aromaticity were therefore accessed in one molecular cage platform, depending on the symmetry, number of pi-electrons and spin state.",2
Branched kissing loops for the construction of diverse RNA homooligomeric nanostructures.,"In biological systems, large and complex structures are often assembled from multiple simpler identical subunits. This strategy-homooligomerization-allows efficient genetic encoding of structures and avoids the need to control the stoichiometry of multiple distinct units. It also allows the minimal number of distinct subunits when designing artificial nucleic acid structures. Here, we present a robust self-assembly system in which homooligomerizable tiles are formed from intramolecularly folded RNA single strands. Tiles are linked through an artificially designed branched kissing-loop motif, involving Watson-Crick base pairing between the single-stranded regions of a bulged helix and a hairpin loop. By adjusting the tile geometry to gain control over the curvature, torsion and the number of helices, we have constructed 16 different linear and circular structures, including a finite-sized three-dimensional cage. We further demonstrate cotranscriptional self-assembly of tiles based on branched kissing loops, and show that tiles inserted into a transfer RNA scaffold can be overexpressed in bacterial cells.",2
Confluence of theory and experiment reveals the catalytic mechanism of the Varkud satellite ribozyme.,"The Varkud satellite ribozyme catalyses site-specific RNA cleavage and ligation, and serves as an important model system to understand RNA catalysis. Here, we combine stereospecific phosphorothioate substitution, precision nucleobase mutation and linear free-energy relationship measurements with molecular dynamics, molecular solvation theory and ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical free-energy simulations to gain insight into the catalysis. Through this confluence of theory and experiment, we unify the existing body of structural and functional data to unveil the catalytic mechanism in unprecedented detail, including the degree of proton transfer in the transition state. Further, we provide evidence for a critical Mg(2+) in the active site that interacts with the scissile phosphate and anchors the general base guanine in position for nucleophile activation. This novel role for Mg(2+) adds to the diversity of known catalytic RNA strategies and unifies functional features observed in the Varkud satellite, hairpin and hammerhead ribozyme classes.",2
Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets.,"Liquid-liquid phase separation plays an important role in cellular organization. Many subcellular condensed bodies are hierarchically organized into multiple coexisting domains or layers. However, our molecular understanding of the assembly and internal organization of these multicomponent droplets is still incomplete, and rules for the coexistence of condensed phases are lacking. Here, we show that the formation of hierarchically organized multiphase droplets with up to three coexisting layers is a generic phenomenon in mixtures of complex coacervates, which serve as models of charge-driven liquid-liquid phase separated systems. We present simple theoretical guidelines to explain both the hierarchical arrangement and the demixing transition in multiphase droplets using the interfacial tensions and critical salt concentration as inputs. Multiple coacervates can coexist if they differ sufficiently in macromolecular density, and we show that the associated differences in critical salt concentration can be used to predict multiphase droplet formation. We also show that the coexisting coacervates present distinct chemical environments that can concentrate guest molecules to different extents. Our findings suggest that condensate immiscibility may be a very general feature in biological systems, which could be exploited to design self-organized synthetic compartments to control biomolecular processes.",2
Chemical Modifications Reduce Auditory Cell Damage Induced by Aminoglycoside Antibiotics.,"Although aminoglycoside antibiotics are effective against Gram-negative infections, these drugs often cause irreversible hearing damage. Binding to the decoding site of the eukaryotic ribosomes appears to result in ototoxicity, but there is evidence that other effects are involved. Here, we show how chemical modifications of apramycin and geneticin, considered among the least and most toxic aminoglycosides, respectively, reduce auditory cell damage. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we studied how modified aminoglycosides influence the essential freedom of movement of the decoding site of the ribosome, the region targeted by aminoglycosides. By determining the ratio of a protein translated in mitochondria to that of a protein translated in the cytoplasm, we showed that aminoglycosides can paradoxically elevate rather than reduce protein levels. We showed that certain aminoglycosides induce rapid plasma membrane permeabilization and that this nonribosomal effect can also be reduced through chemical modifications. The results presented suggest a new paradigm for the development of safer aminoglycoside antibiotics.",2
Isomerization in Alkynyl-Protected Gold Nanoclusters.,"We report the controlled synthesis and structures of two isomeric gold nanoclusters, whose compositions are determined to be Au23(C identical withCBu(t))15 (denoted as Au23-1 and Au23-2) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This is the first time isomerism is discovered in alkynyl-protected gold nanoclusters. The metal-to-ligand ratios in these two clusters are different from known Aun(SR)m systems and have not been observed in the Aux(C identical withCPh)y family. This pair of isomers exhibits different optical properties, although they have similar structures and identical components. For both Au23 clusters, time-dependent density functional theory calculations revealed the frontier orbitals highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-1, HOMO, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are mainly constructed from the Au15 kernel and V-shaped alkynyl-gold motifs. The HOMO --> LUMO transition of Au23-1 is optically forbidden, whereas it is allowed in Au23-2. It is also found that Au23-2 cluster can be transformed to Au23-1 spontaneously under ambient conditions. This work offers further insight into the synthesis and isomerism of all-alkynyl-protected gold nanoclusters and will stimulate more investigation of isomeric metal nanoclusters.",2
Counterion-Mediated Crossing of the Cyanine Limit in Crystals and Fluid Solution: Bond Length Alternation and Spectral Broadening Unveiled by Quantum Chemistry.,"Absorption spectra of cyanine( plus sign in circle).Br( minus sign in circle) salts show a remarkable solvent dependence in non/polar solvents, exhibiting narrow, sharp band shapes in dichloromethane but broad features in toluene; this change was attributed to ion pair association, stabilizing an asymmetric dipolar structure, similar to the situation in the crystal (Bouit, P.-A., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 4328). Our density functional theory (DFT)-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations of the crystals evidence the crucial role of specific asymmetric anion positioning on the lowering of the symmetry. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations prove the ion pair association in nonpolar solvents. Time-dependent DFT vibronic calculations in toluene show that ion pairing indeed stabilizes an asymmetric dipolar structure in the electronic ground state. This largely broadens the absorption spectrum in very reasonable agreement with experiment, while the principal pattern of vibrational modes is retained. The current findings allow us to establish a unified picture of the symmetry breaking of polymethine dyes in fluid solution.",2
Motor and Rotor in One: Light-Active ZnO/Au Twinned Rods of Tunable Motion Modes.,"Precise control of the motion of micromachines is the key to achieving their functions for practical applications. The main challenge is that a given micromachine can typically exhibit only one motion mode, i.e., translation or rotation, while having multiple modes of motion resulting from a simple actuation is still rare. Here we designed and synthesized photochemically powered zinc oxide/gold (ZnO/Au) rods that exhibit multiple motion modes. Under homogeneous UV irradiation, these ZnO/Au rods undergo a transition from ballistic motion to persistent rotational motion upon increasing the fuel concentration or the light intensity. In addition, the rods can switch modes from a circular motion to a helical motion and then a straight-line motion by tuning the angle of incident light. We envision that such attractive colloidal micromachines with controllable motions hold considerable promise for diverse practical applications.",2
Highly Permeable Perfluorinated Sulfonic Acid Ionomers for Improved Electrochemical Devices: Insights into Structure-Property Relationships.,"Rapid improvements in polymer-electrolyte fuel-cell (PEFC) performance have been driven by the development of commercially available ion-conducting polymers (ionomers) that are employed as membranes and catalyst binders in membrane-electrode assemblies. Commercially available ionomers are based on a perfluorinated chemistry comprised of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix that imparts low gas permeability and high mechanical strength but introduces significant mass-transport losses in the electrodes. These transport losses currently limit PEFC performance, especially for low Pt loadings. In this study, we present a novel ionomer incorporating a glassy amorphous matrix based on a perfluoro(2-methylene-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolane) (PFMMD) backbone. The novel backbone chemistry induces structural changes in the ionomer, restricting ionomer domain swelling under hydration while disrupting matrix crystallinity. These structural changes slightly reduce proton conductivity while significantly improving gas permeability. The performance implications of this trade-off are assessed, which reveal the potential for substantial performance improvement by incorporation of highly permeable ionomers as the functional catalyst binder. These results underscore the significance of tailoring material chemistry to specific device requirements, where ionomer chemistry should be rationally designed to match the local transport requirements of the device architecture.",2
Learning from Artemisinin: Bioinspired Design of a Reaction-Based Fluorescent Probe for the Selective Sensing of Labile Heme in Complex Biosystems.,"Labile heme (LH) is an important signaling molecule in virtually all organisms. However, specifically detecting LH remains an outstanding challenge. Herein, by learning from the bioactivation mechanism of artemisinin, we have developed the first LH-responsive small-molecule fluorescent probe, HNG, based on a 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (NG) fluorophore. HNG showed high selectivity for LH without interference from hemin, protein-interacting heme, and zinc protoporphyrin. Using HNG, the changes of LH levels in live cells were imaged, and a positive correlation of LH level with the degree of hemolysis was uncovered in hemolytic mice. Our study not only presents the first molecular probe for specific LH detection but also provides a strategy to construct probes with high specificity through a bioinspired approach.",2
Controlling the Oxidation State of the Cu Electrode and Reaction Intermediates for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Ethylene.,"Understanding the role of the oxidation state of the Cu surface and surface-adsorbed intermediate species in electrochemical CO2 reduction is crucial for the development of selective CO2-to-fuel electrocatalysts. In this study, the electrochemical CO2 reduction mechanism over the Cu catalysts with various oxidation states was studied by using in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Cu L-edge), and online gas chromatography measurements. The atop-adsorbed CO (COatop) intermediate is obtained on the electrodeposited Cu surface which primarily has the oxidation state of Cu(I). COatop is further reduced, followed by the formation of C1 product such as CH4. The residual bridge-adsorbed CO (CObridge) is formed on the as-prepared Cu surface with Cu(0) which inhibits hydrocarbon formation. In contrast, the CV-treated Cu electrode prepared by oxidizing the as-prepared Cu surface contains different amounts of Cu(I) and Cu(0) states. The major theme of this work is that in situ SEIRAS results show the coexistence of COatop and CObridge as the reaction intermediates during CO2 reduction and that the selectivity of CO2-to-ethylene conversion is further enhanced in the CV-treated Cu electrode. The Cu catalysts modulated by the electrochemical method exhibit different oxidation states and reaction intermediates as well as electrocatalytic properties.",2
Heterogeneous Reactions of SO3 on Ice: An Overlooked Sink for SO3 Depletion.,"The reaction between SO3 and water in the gas phase has always been of great interest, as it has important implications in atmospheric and environmental science. Compared to gas-phase water, however, heterogeneous hydration of SO3 on the surfaces of condensed phases of water/ice is relatively less explored. Here, we present a systematic study of the reactions between SO3 and three different phases of water, namely, water vapor, the surface of a liquid water droplet, and the {11-20} plane of hexagonal ice (Ih). The computational results show that, contrary to the gas-phase water, the surface of a water droplet and the {11-20} plane of Ih ice play distinctly different roles in the reaction, in which the HSO4(-)/H3O(+) is formed within a few picoseconds. Moreover, the SO3 hydration exhibits multiple reaction pathways on the surface of a water droplet and the {11-20} plane of Ih ice, including a newly observed chemical mechanism without the formation of water-loop structures. Considering temperature effects (winter vs summer), SO3/water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere, and the effective surface areas of water droplets in the atmosphere and ice on the ground, the reaction rates of SO3 with water in the gas phase, in aerosols, in clouds, and on snowpack are estimated and compared. Consistent with previous experimental studies, the loss rates of SO3 due to aerosols and clouds are less important compared to that due to water vapor. Surprisingly, the ice snowpack is shown to be an efficient sink for SO3 depletion, especially in the winter season.",2
Manipulating On/Off Single-Molecule Magnet Behavior in a Dy(III)-Based Photochromic Complex.,"Exploitation of room temperature (RT) photochromism and photomagnetism to induce single-molecule magnet (SMM) behavior has potential applications toward optical switches and magnetic memories, and remains a tremendous challenge in the development of new bulk magnets. Herein, a series of chain complexes [Ln3(H-HEDP)3(H2-HEDP)3].2H3-TPT.H4-HEDP.10H2O (QDU-1; Ln = Dy (QDU-1(Dy)), Gd (QDU-1(Gd)), and Y (QDU-1(Y)); HEDP = hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate; TPT = 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine) were synthesized by solvothermal reactions. All the compounds exhibited reversible photochromic and photomagnetic behaviors via UV light irradiation at RT, induced by the photogenerated radicals via a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism. More importantly, the PET process induced significant variations in magnetic interactions for the Dy(III) congener. Strong ferromagnetic coupling with remarkably slow magnetic relaxation without applied dc fields was observed between Dy(III) ions and photogenerated O(*) radicals, showing SMM behavior after RT illumination. For the first time, we observed the reversible RT photochromism and photomagnetism in the lanthanide-based materials. This work realized the radicals-actuated on/off SMM behavior via RT light irradiation, providing a new strategy for constructing the light-induced SMMs.",2
Strong Negative Thermal Expansion in a Low-Cost and Facile Oxide of Cu2P2O7.,"Negative thermal expansion (NTE) behaviors have been observed in various types of compounds. The achievement in the merits of promising low-cost and facile NTE oxides remains challenging. In the present work, a simple and low-cost Cu2P2O7 has been found to exhibit the strongest NTE among the oxides (alphaV approximately -27.69 x 10(-6) K(-1), 5-375 K). The complex NTE mechanism has been investigated by the combined methods of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, X-ray pair distribution function, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. Interesting, the direct experimental evidence reveals that the coupling twist and rotation of PO4 and CuO5 polyhedra are the inherent factors for the NTE nature of Cu2P2O7, which is triggered by the transverse vibrations of oxygen atoms. The present new NTE material of Cu2P2O7 also has been verified for the practical application.",2
Heat Stroke in Cell Tissues Related to Sulfur Dioxide Level Is Precisely Monitored by Light-Controlled Fluorescent Probes.,"Heat stroke (HS) can cause serious organism damage or even death. Early understanding of the mechanism of heat cytotoxicity can prevent or treat heat stroke related diseases. In this work, probe Ly-NT-SP was synthesized, characterized, and used for sulfur dioxide (SO2) detection in lysosomes. PBS solutions of probe Ly-NT-SP at pH 5.0 present a marked broad emission band in the green zone (535 nm). After UV irradiation, the spiropyran group in Ly-NT-SP isomerizes to the merocyanine form (Ly-NT-MR), which presented a weak red-shifted emission at 630 nm. In addition, photocontrolled isomerization of Ly-NT-SP to Ly-NT-MR generated a C horizontal lineC-C horizontal lineN(+) fragment able to react, through a Michael addition, with SO2 to yield a highly emissive adduct with a marked fluorescence in the green channel (535 nm). In vitro studies showed a remarkable selectivity of photoactivated Ly-NT-MR to SO2 with a limit of detection as low as 4.7 muM. MTT viability assays demonstrated that the Ly-NT-SP is nontoxic to HeLa cells and can be used to detect SO2 in lysosomes. Taking advantage of this, the sensor is successfully applied to image increasing SO2 values in lysosomes during heat shock for the first time. Moreover, we also confirmed that the increased SO2 can protect the small intestine against damage induced by heat shock through regulating oxidative stress in cells and mice.",2
pi-Coordinating Chiral Primary Amine/Palladium Synergistic Catalysis for Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation.,"We report an arene-containing chiral primary amine as a dual aminocatalyst and ligand: the pi-coordinating aminocatalyst/palladium synergistic catalysis for asymmetric allylic alkylation of alpha-branched beta-ketocarbonyls. The use of arene-containing chiral primary amine catalyst led to not only enhanced reaction rate but also reversed chiral induction compared with its sterically bulky derivative. Both enantiomers of the allylic adducts bearing acyclic all-carbon quaternary stereocenters could be obtained from the same configured chiral aminocatalysts with high efficiency and excellent regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies revealed a distinctive Pd-arene pi-coordination mode for effective catalysis. The pi-coordinating chiral primary amine catalyst could be successfully applied in the asymmetric allylation reactions of vinylethylene carbonates, vinyl epoxides, or simple allylic alcohols.",2
Revealing a Decisive Role for Secondary Coordination Sphere Nucleophiles on Methane Activation.,"Density functional theory and ab initio calculations indicate that nucleophiles can significantly reduce enthalpic barriers to methane C-H bond activation. Valence bond analysis suggests the formation of a two-center three-electron bond as the origin for the catalytic nucleophile effect. A predictive model for methane activation catalysis follows, which suggests that strongly electron-attracting and electron-rich radicals, together with both a negatively charged and strongly electron-donating outer sphere nucleophile, result in the lowest reaction barriers. It is corroborated by the sensitivity of the calculated C-H activation barriers to the external nucleophile and to continuum solvent polarity. More generally, from the present studies, one may propose proteins with hydrophobic active sites, available strong nucleophiles, and hydrogen bond donors as attractive targets for engineering novel methane functionalizing enzymes.",2
Metathetical Exchange between Metal-Metal Triple Bonds.,"The reaction of the molybdenum-molybdenum triple-bonded dimer (CO)2CpMo identical withMoCp(CO)2 (Cp = eta(5)-C5H5) with the triple-bonded dimetallynes Ar(iPr4)MMAr(iPr4) or Ar(iPr6)MMAr(iPr6) (Ar(iPr4) = C6H3-2,6-(C6H3-2,6-Pr(i)2)2, Ar(iPr6) = C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-Pr(i)3)2; M = Ge, Sn, or Pb) under mild conditions (</=80 degrees C, 1 bar) afforded Ar(iPr4)M identical withMoCp(CO)2 or Ar(iPr6)M identical withMoCp(CO)2 in moderate to excellent yields. The reactions represent the first isolable products from a metathesis of two metal-metal triple bonds. Analogous exchange reactions with the single-bonded (CO)3CpMo-MoCp(CO)3 gave ArM-MoCp(CO)3 (Ar = Ar(iPr4) or Ar(iPr6); M = Sn or Pb). The products were characterized by NMR ((1)H, (13)C, (119)Sn, or (207)Pb), electronic, and IR spectroscopy and by X-ray crystallography.",2
The Grignard Reaction - Unraveling a Chemical Puzzle.,"More than 100 years since its discovery, the mechanism of the Grignard reaction remains unresolved. Ambiguities arise from the concomitant presence of multiple organomagnesium species and the competing mechanisms involving either nucleophilic addition or the formation of radical intermediates. To shed light on this topic, quantum-chemical calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the reaction of CH3MgCl in tetrahydrofuran with acetaldehyde and fluorenone as prototypical reagents. All organomagnesium species coexisting in solution due to the Schlenk equilibrium are found to be competent reagents for the nucleophilic pathway. The range of activation energies displayed by all of these compounds is relatively small. The most reactive species are a dinuclear Mg complex in which the substrate and the nucleophile initially bind to different Mg centers and the mononuclear dimethyl magnesium. The radical reaction, which requires the homolytic cleavage of the Mg-CH3 bond, cannot occur unless a substrate with a low-lying pi*(CO) orbital coordinates the Mg center. This rationalizes why a radical mechanism is detected only in the presence of substrates with a low reduction potential. This feature, in turn, does not necessarily favor the nucleophilic addition, as shown for the reaction with fluorenone. The solvent needs to be considered as a reactant for both the nucleophilic and the radical reactions, and its dynamics is essential for representing the energy profile. The similar reactivity of several species in fast equilibrium implies that the reaction does not occur via a single process but by an ensemble of parallel reactions.",2
Structure-Guided Improvement of a Dual HPIV3/RSV Fusion Inhibitor.,"Human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are leading causes of lower respiratory tract infections. There are currently no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics to treat HPIV3 or RSV infections. We recently reported a peptide (VIQKI), derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of the HPIV3 fusion (F) glycoprotein that inhibits infection by both HPIV3 and RSV. The dual inhibitory activity of VIQKI is due to its unique ability to bind to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRN) domains of both HPIV3 and RSV F, thereby preventing the native HRN-HRC interactions required for viral entry. Here we describe the structure-guided design of dual inhibitors of HPIV3 and RSV fusion with improved efficacy. We show that VIQKI derivatives possessing one (I456F) or two (I454F/I456F) phenylalanine substitutions near the N-terminus exhibit more stable assemblies with the RSV-HRN domain and enhanced antiviral efficacy against both HPIV3 and RSV infection. Cocrystal structures of the new Phe-substituted inhibitors coassembled with HPIV3 or RSV-HRN domains reveal that the I456F substitution makes intimate hydrophobic contact with the core trimers of both HPIV3 and RSV F.",2
"A Concise, Enantioselective Approach for the Synthesis of Yohimbine Alkaloids.","We report a concise, enantioselective synthesis of the yohimbine alkaloids (-)-rauwolscine and (-)-alloyohimbane. The key transformation involves a highly enantio- and diastereoselective NHC-catalyzed dimerization and an amidation/N-acyliminium ion cyclization sequence to furnish four of the five requisite rings and three of the five stereocenters in two operations. This route also provides efficient access to all four diastereomeric arrangements of the core stereotriad of the yohimbine alkaloids from a common intermediate. This platform approach in combination with the ability to access both enantiomers from the carbene-catalyzed reaction is a powerful strategy that can produce a wide range of complex alkaloids and related structures for future biomedical investigations.",2
Potent Reductants via Electron-Primed Photoredox Catalysis: Unlocking Aryl Chlorides for Radical Coupling.,"We describe a new catalytic strategy to transcend the energetic limitations of visible light by electrochemically priming a photocatalyst prior to excitation. This new catalytic system is able to productively engage aryl chlorides with reduction potentials hundreds of millivolts beyond the potential of Na(0) in productive radical coupling reactions. The aryl radicals produced via this strategy can be leveraged for both carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming reactions. Through direct comparison, we illustrate the reactivity and selectivity advantages of this approach relative to electrolysis and photoredox catalysis.",2
Reductive Electrophotocatalysis: Merging Electricity and Light To Achieve Extreme Reduction Potentials.,"We describe a new electrophotocatalytic strategy that harnesses the power of light and electricity to generate an excited radical anion with a reducing potential of -3.2 V vs SCE, which can be used to activate substrates with very high reduction potentials (Ered approximately -1.9 to -2.9 V). The resultant aryl radicals can be engaged in various synthetically useful transformations to furnish arylboronate, arylstannane, and biaryl products.",2
Beyond Koopmans' theorem: electron binding energies in disordered materials.,"The topical review focuses on calculating ionization energies (IE), or electronic polarons in quasi-particle terminology, in large disordered systems, e.g. for a solute dissolved in a molecular solvent. The simplest estimate of the ionization energy is provided by one-electron energies in the Hartree-Fock theory, but the calculated quantities are not accurate. Density functional theory as many-body theory provides a principal opportunity for calculating one-electron energies including correlation and relaxation effects, i.e. the true energies of electronic polarons. We argue that such a principal possibility materializes within the concept of optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals (OT-RSH). We describe various schemes for optimal tuning. Importantly, the OT-RSH scheme is investigated for systems capped with dielectric continuum, providing a consistent picture on the QM/dielectric boundary. Finally, some limitations and open issues of the OT-RSH approach are addressed.",3
Measurement of entropic force from polymers attached to a pyramidal tip.,"The measurement of the boundary shape dependence of the entropic force from long polymers was attempted. The pyramidal cone-plate geometry was chosen. The polymer molecules were covalently bound to a well-defined Au patch at the apex of a pyramidal cantilever tip of the atomic force microscope (AFM). A smooth hydrophobic plate was used as the second boundary to confine the polymer molecules. The use of the hydrophobic plate allows neglect of polymer adhesion forces. The measurements were made in salt water solution to decrease the effect of electrostatic forces from any uncompensated charges on the boundary. As the functionalized AFM tip approaches the flat hydrophobic surface, the induced entropic forces were measured as a function of the separation distance. The measured force-distance curves are compared with a model of polymer-mediated entropic force between scale-free objects and the Alexander-de Gennes (AdG) theory for a polymer brush.",3
Localized magnetic moments in metallic SrB6 single crystals.,"The specific heat [Formula: see text] of metallic SrB6 single crystals shows an anomalous behavior for [Formula: see text] K which varies strongly with an applied magnetic field. This is consistent with a two-level Schottky system. We ascribe the excess of [Formula: see text] in this temperature range to localized magnetic moments. In addition, features that are attributable to a partial ferromagnetic polarization of a conduction electron gas are observed. These results are supported by magnetization measurements and are compatible with the transport properties reported previously (Stankiewicz 2016 Phys. Rev. B 94 125141).",3
Energy conversion from environmental fluctuations to coherent fields by Cooper-pair box quantum meta-materials.,"Electromagnetic waves propagating in open Cooper-pair boxes (CPBs) system is studied by using Maxwell-Bloch equations and Lindblad master equation. The results demonstrate an ensemble of CPBs as highly non-linear meta-material for electromagnetic waves. Incorporating the CPBs in a ring resonator or a Fabry-Perot cavity, one finds that: (1) With weak environmental couplings and CPBs in superconducting phase dominant regime, the non-linearity is enhanced and the system exhibits regular optical hysteresis. (2) With finite environmental couplings and CPBs in charge dominant regime, the Josephson effect and environmental effect can constructively interplay to produce a gain. In the later case, the electromagnetic field would be amplified by the CPB medium, indicating energy conversion from the environment to coherent fields mediated by CPBs.",3
Diels-Alder adduct formation at solid interfaces between fullerenes and acenes.,"Understanding organic-organic interfaces is rather challenging due to their large complexity regarding morphology, molecular orientation at the interface, interdiffusion, and energetics. One additional important but often neglected aspect are chemical reactions occuring at such interfaces. For solid interfaces between pentacene and Buckminster-Fullerene (C60) recently very efficient Diels-Alder (D-A) adduct formation has been reported. Considering the importance of pentacene/C60 as prototypical donor-acceptor combination to study fundamental processes in organic photovoltaics, understanding this effect is essential. In this work, we provide detailed NEXAFS-based investigations with respect to the temperature-dependence and reaction zone depth of this effect. Moreover, we widely vary the interface morphology and observe that the D-A adduct formation is most efficient for bulk heterojunctions of pentacene and C60. By also investigating further material combinations such as PEN/C60-PCBM and interfaces between C60 and functionalized acenes, we observe trends for the occurrence of the D-A adduct formation correlated with the different chemical properties of the involved compounds.",3
Improved Hubbard-I approximation impurity solver for quantum impurity models.,"We develop a fast impurity solver which is based on the combination of Hubbard-I approximation and hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. This solver inherits the advantages of both algorithms. In order to demonstrate the power and usefulness of this solver, we use it to study the magnetic phase transitions of single-band and two-band Hubbard models in the framework of single-site dynamical mean-field theory. The calculated results agree well with those obtained by hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver. It is suggested that this solver is very suitable to solve the multi-orbital quantum impurity models efficiently and can be used to study more realistic systems with magnetic long-range order in the future.",3
Generalized stacking fault energy of carbon-alloyed paramagnetic [Formula: see text]-Fe.,"Generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) is an important parameter for understanding the underlying physics governing the deformation mechanisms in face-centred cubic (fcc) materials. In the present work, we study the long-standing question regarding the influence of C on the GSFE in austenitic steels at paramagnetic state. We calculate the GSFE in both [Formula: see text]-Fe and Fe-C alloys using the exact muffin-tin orbitals method and the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. Our results show that the GSFE is increased by the presence of interstitial C, and the universal scaling law is used to verify the accuracy of the obtained stacking fault energies. The C-driven change of the GSFE is discussed considering the magnetic contributions. The effective energy barriers for stacking fault, twinning and slip formation are employed to disclose the C effect on the deformation modes, and we also demonstrate that the magnetic structures as a function of volume explain the effect of paramagnetism on the C-driven changes of the stacking fault energies as compared to the hypothetical non-magnetic case.",3
"Stability, spontaneous and induced polarization in monolayer MoC, WC, WS, and WSe.","Ferroelectricity in the ultra-low thin films of the ferroelectric materials is a rare phenomenon due to the depolarization electric field established by the uncompensated surface charge. Using density functional theory based calculations, we design buckled honeycomb binary monolayer MoC, WC, WS, and WSe. The feasibility of their experimental synthesis is evident from their low formation energies, stable lattice vibrations, and high elastic stiffnesses. The difference in electronegativity of the building atoms and lack of inversion symmetry results in high spontaneous out-of-plane polarization whereas all the in-plane components cancel out. The existence of the mirror plane along the armchair direction vanishes the in-plane piezoelectric stress effects for a strain applied along the zigzag direction. However, a strain along the armchair direction on MoC and WC results in a high piezoelectric coefficient up to 10 [Formula: see text] 10[Formula: see text] C m[Formula: see text], about three times larger than that reported for monolayer MoS[Formula: see text]. The polarization switching barriers for the out-of-plane components range from 0.55 to 2.70 eV per formula unit.",3
Half-metallic surfaces in thin-film Ti2MnAl0.5Sn0.5.,"Materials exhibiting a high degree of spin polarization in electron transport are in demand for applications in spintronics-an emerging technology utilizing a spin degree of freedom in electronic devices. Room-temperature half-metals are considered ideal candidates, as they behave as an insulator for one spin channel and as a conductor for the other spin channel. In addition, for nano-size devices, one has to take into account possible modification of electronic structure in thin-film geometry, due to the potential presence of surface/interface states. It has been shown that typically these states have a detrimental impact on half-metallicity, i.e. their presence results in reduced spin-polarization. Here, we employ density functional calculations to explore an inverse Heusler compound, Ti2MnAl0.5Sn0.5, which exhibits half-metallic electronic structure in bulk geometry. In particular, this material behaves as a regular metal for majority-spin, and as a semiconductor for minority-spin states. We show that in thin-film geometry, the type of termination surface has a decisive effect on half-metallicity of this material. In particular, we analyze six possible termination configurations, and show that for four of them, energy states emerge in the minority-spin band gap, significantly reducing the spin polarization of Ti2MnAl0.5Sn0.5. At the same time, our calculations indicate that two termination surfaces preserve half-metallic properties of this material. This result is somewhat unexpected, as most of the available literature reports reduction of the spin-polarization due to the presence of surface states. Thus, our results show that a judicious choice of the termination surface may be a crucial factor in nano-device applications, where highly spin-polarized current is needed.",3
Topological 'Luttinger' invariants for filling-enforced non-symmorphic semimetals.,"Luttinger's theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of interacting Fermi systems: it states that the volume inside the Fermi surface is left invariant by interactions, if the number of particles is held fixed. Although this is traditionally justified in terms of analytic properties of Green's functions, it can be viewed as arising from a momentum balance argument that examines the response of the ground state to the insertion of a single flux quantum (Oshikawa 2000 Phys. Rev. Lett. 84 3370). This reveals that the Fermi volume is a topologically protected quantity, whose change requires a phase transition. However, this sheds no light on the stability or lack thereof of interacting semimetals, that either lack a Fermi surface, or have perfectly compensated electron and hole pockets and hence vanishing net Fermi volume. Here, I show that semimetallic phases in non-symmorphic crystals possess additional topological 'Luttinger invariants' that can be nonzero even though the Fermi volume vanishes. The existence of these invariants is linked to the inability of non-symmorphic crystals to host band insulating ground states except at special fillings. I exemplify the use of these new invariants by showing that they distinguish various classes of two- and three-dimensional semimetals.",3
The role of self-trapped excitons in polaronic recombination processes in lithium niobate.,"Transient absorption and photoluminescence are experimentally investigated in the polaronic reference system lithium niobate, LiNbO[Formula: see text] (LN), with the aim to refine the microscopic model of small polaron dynamics in materials with strong electron-phonon coupling. As a unique feature, our study is performed by using two different spectroscopic methods, in crystals with dopants enhancing photorefraction or damage resistance, and over a broad temperature range from 15-400 K. Although being self-consistent for particular experimental conditions, the hitherto used microscopic polaronic models reveal inconsistencies when applied to this larger data set. We show that comprehensive modeling is unlocked by the inclusion of an additional type of polaronic state with the following characteristics: (i) strongly temperature- and dopant-dependent relaxation times, (ii) an absorption feature in the blue-green spectral range, and (iii) a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts decay shape with a temperature-dependent stretching factor [Formula: see text] showing a behavior contrary to that of small, strong-coupling polarons. The hypothesis of self-trapped excitons (STEs, i.e. bound electron-hole pairs strongly coupled to Nb[Formula: see text] and O[Formula: see text] within a niobium-oxygen octahedron) and their pinning on defects as the microscopic origin of these characteristics is supported by a spectroscopic linkage of photoluminescence at low (15 K) and elevated (300 K) temperatures and explains the long-lifetime components in transient absorption as due to pinned STEs.",3
Quantized dislocations.,"A dislocation, just like a phonon, is a type of atomic lattice displacement but subject to an extra topological constraint. However, unlike the phonon which has been quantized for decades, the dislocation has long remained classical. This article is a comprehensive review of the recent progress on quantized dislocations, aka the 'dislon' theory. Since the dislon utilizes quantum field theory to solve materials defects problems, we adopt a pedagogical approach to facilitate understanding for both materials science and condensed matter communities. After introducing a few preliminary concepts of dislocations, we focus on the necessity and pathways of dislocation's quantization in great detail, followed by the interaction mechanism between the dislon and materials electronic and phononic degrees of freedom. We emphasize the formality, the new phenomena, and the predictive power. Imagine the leap from classical lattice wave to quantized phonon; the dislon theory may open up vast opportunities to compute dislocated materials at a full quantum many-body level.",3
Realizing both giant magnetic anisotropy and quantum anomalous Hall effect in graphene with adsorbed Te-Co dimer.,"To realize quantum anomalous Hall state at higher temperature, it needs to search for the magnetic topological insulators with giant magnetic anisotropy. We have studied the structural, magnetic and topological properties of graphene with adsorbed Te-A (A [Formula: see text] Co, Rh, Ir) dimers by first-principles calculations and Wannier technique. Our results reveal that the system of Te-Co@G is an excellent magnetic topological insulator with both perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of 61.7 meV and large topological band-gap of 35.8 meV. Both the magnetic anisotropy and the band-gap can be effectively tuned by the applied electric field. The dimers are stably adsorbed onto the graphene and the systems are robust against thermal fluctuation. Topological analysis reveals that the adsorption system is the Chern insulator with [Formula: see text].",3
Asymmetrically optimized structure in a high-T c single unit-cell FeSe superconductor.,"We report asymmetric Se heights in a single unit-cell (UC) FeSe on SrTiO3(0 0 1) substrate with the highest superconducting transition temperature (T c) among the Fe-based superconductors revealed by total-reflection high-energy positron diffraction measurements. Among various iron-based superconductors, this single UC FeSe on the SrTiO3(0 0 1) has been the best material to achieve the highest-T c above 50 K. We found the asymmetric Se heights of 1.44 +/- 0.03 and 1.33 +/- 0.03 A from the single Fe layer by the intensity analysis based on dynamical diffraction theory. The average Se height results in 1.39 +/- 0.04 A, corresponding to the optimum value for Fe-based superconductors. In addition, the average of bond angles of Se-Fe-Se, 107.2 +/- 1.1 and 111.5 +/- 1.2 degrees becomes 109.3 +/- 1.6 degrees , which is close to the optimum value of 109.5 degrees for a regular tetrahedron. Thus, this single UC FeSe is found to have asymmetrically optimized structure. Based on our first-principles calculations, the asymmetry does not change the bandwidth whereas it splits the electron bands at the M point only at the bottom. These calculations suggest that at low electron doping, the structural asymmetry is expected to lead to exotic properties of non-centrosymmetric superconductivity, whereas after a certain amount of electron doping, average anion height plays an important role for high-T c.",3
Modeling of high-fluence irradiation of amorphous Si and crystalline Al by linearly focused Ar ions.,"Long time ion irradiation of surfaces under tilted incidence causes formation of regular nanostructures known as surface ripples. The nature of mechanisms leading to ripples is still not clear, this is why computational methods can shed the light on such a complex phenomenon and help to understand which surface processes are mainly responsible for it. In this work, we analyse the surface response of two materials, a semiconductor (silicon) and a metal (aluminium) under irradiation with the 250 eV and 1000 eV Ar ions focused at 70 degrees from the normal to the surface. We simulate consecutive ion impacts by the means of molecular dynamics to investigate the effect on ripple formation. We find that the redistribution mechanism seems to be the main creator of ripples in amorphous materials, while the erosion mechanism is the leading origin for the pattern formation in crystalline metals.",3
"Corrigendum: Numerical analysis of surface and edge states in slabs, stripes, rods and surface steps of topological insulators (N I Fedotov and S V Zaitsev-Zotov 2018 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 30 485301).",Corrigendum.,3
Fabry-Perot interferometry in Weyl semi-metals.,We show that the electrical transport across a minimal model for a time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl semi-metal (WSM) involving two Weyl nodes can be interpreted as an interferometer in momentum space. The interference phase depends on the distance between the Weyl nodes ([Formula: see text]) and is anisotropic. It is further shown that a minimal inversion symmetry broken model for a WSM with four Weyl nodes effectively mimics a situation corresponding to having two copies of the interferometer due to the presence of an orbital pseudo-spin domain wall in momentum space. We point out that the value of the [Formula: see text] and consequently the interference phase can be tuned by driving the WSMs resulting in oscillations in the two terminal conductance measured in the direction of splitting of the Weyl nodes.,3
Role of tetrahedrally coordinated dopants in palladium hydrides on their superconductivity and inverse isotope effect.,"Absorption of hydrogen by palladium causes PdH to become superconducting below [Formula: see text]. Due to the presence of one octapore and two tetrapores per each Pd atom, it is believed that [Formula: see text] of PdH[Formula: see text] should increase further. Here, using ab initio calculation we show that (i) H placed in tetrapores of PdH[Formula: see text] induces a wide optical gap in the phonon density of states, which significantly reduces the electron-phonon coupling, and that (ii) the energetically preferable octapores filled by H enable the 9 K superconductivity only. This scenario may close a long-standing problem of the high-[Formula: see text] palladium hydrides. Moreover, simulating the pore population by H and D, within ab initio molecular dynamics, we are able to explain the inverse isotope effect in the framework of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory.",3
Secondary electron emission and yield spectra of metals from Monte Carlo simulations and experiments.,"In this work, we present a computational method, based on the Monte Carlo statistical approach, for calculating electron energy emission and yield spectra of metals, such as copper, silver and gold. The calculation of these observables proceeds via the Mott theory with a Dirac-Hartree-Fock spherical potential to deal with the elastic scattering processes, and by using the Ritchie dielectric approach to model the electron inelastic scattering events. In the latter case, the dielectric function, which represents the starting point for the evaluation of the energy loss, is obtained from experimental reflection electron energy loss spectra. The generation of secondary electrons upon ionization of the samples is also implemented in the calculation. A remarkable agreement is obtained between both theoretical and experimental electron emission spectra and yield curves.",3
Oxide thin films as bioactive coatings.,"Growth and survival of biological cells (eukaryotes and prokaryotes) on artificial environments often depend on their interactions with the specific surface. Various organic materials can be coated on substrates to assist cells' adhesion and other subsequent cellular processes. However, these coatings are expensive, degrade over short time period, and may even interfere with the cells' signaling processes. Therefore, the use of inorganic surfaces in order to control cellular interactions is of scientific importance from fundamental and application perspectives. Among inorganic materials, oxide thin films have received considerable attention. Thin films of oxides have the advantage of tailoring the surfaces for cellular interactions while using a negligible amount of the oxide material. Here, we review the lesser known application of inorganic oxide coatings as biocompatible and implantable platforms for different purposes, such as biofilm inhibition, cell culture and implant enhancements.",3
Novel pressure-induced topological phase transitions of supercooled liquid and amorphous silicene.,"This molecular dynamics (MD) simulation carries a detailed analysis of a pressure-induced structural transition supercooled liquid and amorphous silicene (a-silicene). Low-density models of supercooled liquid and a-silicene containing 10 000 atoms are obtained by rapid cooling processes from the melts. Then, an a-silicene model at T = 1000 K, a supercooled liquid model at T = 1500 K and a liquid silicon model at T = 2000 K have been isothermally compressed step by step up to a high density in order to observe the pressure-induced structural changes. Specifically 'Cairo tiling' pentagonal and square lattices of silicene are discovered in our calculations. Structural properties of those penta-silicene and tetra-silicene models have been carefully analyzed through the radial distribution functions, interatomic distances, bond-angle distributions under high-pressure condition. The dependence of pressure on formation behaviors is calculated via pressure-volume and energy-density relationships. The first order transition from low-density supercooled liquid/amorphous silicene to high-density penta-silicene and continuous transition from low-density liquid to high-density tetra-silicene are discussed. Atomic mechanism and sp(3)/sp(2) hybridization evolution are inspected whereas the role of low-membered ring defects/boundary promises remarkable application and advanced research in future.",3
"The huge effect of Mn substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of LaFeAsO: the La(Fe,Mn)AsO system.","The substitution of Mn for Fe on the sub-lattice in LaFeAsO has a remarkable impact on both structural and magnetic properties; for example, the structural and magnetic transition temperatures decrease of ~20 K in samples with a Mn-content as low as x = 0.01. Such a dramatic effect results from the high stability of the substituting Mn(2+) ion (3d (5)) in its high-spin state, which opposes any variation to its electronic state (configuration), perturbing thereby interactions within the Fe sub-lattice between the Fe ions surrounding the substituent. Several investigations ascertained that the structural transformation in LnFeAsO compounds (Ln: lanthanide) cannot be ascribed to lattice degrees of freedom, but rather to electronic or spin ones. In this context, even an extremely low concentration of Mn(2+) ions diluted in the Fe sub-lattice produces a reduction of the electronic degree of freedom of the system, thus hindering the structural transformation and the magnetic transition.",3
Exciting vibrons in both frontier orbitals of a single hydrocarbon molecule on graphene.,"Vibronic excitations in molecules are key to the fundamental understanding of the interaction between vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom. In order to probe the genuine vibronic properties of a molecule even after its adsorption on a surface appropriate buffer layers are of paramount importance. Here, vibrational progression in both molecular frontier orbitals is observed with submolecular resolution on a graphene-covered metal surface using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Accompanying calculations demonstrate that the vibrational modes that cause the orbital replica in the progression share the same symmetry as the electronic states they couple to. In addition, the vibrational progression is more pronounced for separated molecules than for molecules embedded in molecular assemblies. The entire vibronic spectra of these molecular species are moreover rigidly shifted with respect to each other. This work unravels intramolecular changes in the vibronic and electronic structure owing to the efficient reduction of the molecule-metal hybridization by graphene.",3
Structural transformations and physical properties of (1 - x) Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 - x BaTiO3 solid solutions near a morphotropic phase boundary.,"Piezoelectric and other physical properties are significantly enhanced at (or near) a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in ferroelectrics. MPB materials have attracted significant attention owing to both fundamental physics as well as the possibility of well-regulated energy and information storage devices which are dominated by lead (Pb)-based materials. Here, we report the crystal structure, Raman spectra, dielectric constant and polarization near the MPB of lead free (1 - x) Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 - x BaTiO3 (0.00 x 0.10) solid-solution, prepared by sol-gel auto combustion technique and sintered by microwave sintering technique. With the addition of BaTiO3 into Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3, it induces a structural phase transition from R3c (a single phase) to R3c + P4mm (a dual phase) close to x = 0.06 and 0.07 and transform to a high symmetry tetragonal phase P4mm at higher compositions (x = 0.08 to 0.10) as evident from our x-ray Rietveld refinement and Raman spectroscopic results. We perform first-principles calculations based on density functional theory that confirm a structural transition from a rhombohedral to a tetragonal phase under increasing x. In the prepared solid solution, an anomalous enhancement of remnant polarization ([Formula: see text]) was observed for x = 0.06 and 0.07, which has been explained based on the existence of the MPB. On the other hand, the value of coercive field [Formula: see text] was found to be decreased linearly from x = 0.00 to 0.06; it is constant for higher compositions. Further details of the ferroelectric properties on the electric field poled samples have been studied and compared with the as-grown (unpoled) samples.",3
Spontaneous assembly of colloidal vesicles driven by active swimmers.,"We explore the self-assembly process of colloidal structures immersed in active baths. By considering low-valence particles we numerically investigate the irreversible aggregation dynamics originated by the presence of run-and-tumble swimmers. We observe the formation of long closed chains-vesicles-densely filled by active swimmers. On the one hand the active bath drives the self-assembly of closed colloidal structures, and on the other hand the vesicles formation fosters the self-trapping of swimmers, suggesting new ways both to build structured nanomaterials and to trap microorganisms.",3
Monoclinic SrIrO3-a Dirac semimetal produced by non-symmorphic symmetry and spin-orbit coupling.,"SrIrO3 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure of distorted hexagonal perovskite at ambient pressure. The transport measurements show that the monoclinic SrIrO3 is a low-carrier density semimetal, as in the orthorhombic perovskite polymorph. The electronic structure calculation indicates a semimetallic band structure with Dirac bands at two high-symmetry points of Brillouin zone only when spin-orbit coupling is incorporated, suggesting that the semimetallic state is produced by the strong spin-orbit coupling. We argue that the Dirac bands are protected by the non-symmorphic symmetry of lattice.",3
Thermal conductivity of TiO2 nanotube: a molecular dynamics study.,"The thermal conductivity of anatase TiO2 nanotubes was investigated using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on Green-Kubo formalism. The calculated thermal conductivity of [Formula: see text] for anatase crystal at room temperature agrees well with experimental value of ~8.5 W K(-1) . m(-1), demonstrating that the method used in our calculation can provide a good description for the thermal transport of TiO2. The dependence of the thermal conductivity of TiO2 nanotubes with temperature, tube size and chirality were studied in detail. The relationship between the thermal conductivity and the vibrational density-of-states of the nanotubes was also investigated.",3
Chemistry in confined space through the eyes of surface science-2D porous materials.,"There are a rapidly growing number of studies showing exciting new opportunities in the way confinement effects on surfaces affect the properties of materials and their chemistry. These effects have been observed recently under two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials such as a graphene and boron nitride and for the case of supported 2D-porous oxides, including silicates, aluminosilicates and zeolite nanosheets. This review summarizes the current state of the art in this area of research and how confinement effects in 2D systems relate to those found in 3D porous and layered materials. The focus of this review is put in 2D-materials with inherent porosity, such as 2D-porous oxides. An outlook is also given for the future of this exciting emerging area.",3
"Mode confinement, interface mass-smudging, and sample length effects on phonon transport in thin nanocomposite superlattices.","We employ a semi-ab initio theoretical method to investigate mode confinement, interface mass-smudging, and sample length effects on phonon transport in thin nanocomposite superlattices. We present a detailed comparative study of numerical results showing the reduction in thermal conductivity due to each of these three effects for Si/Ge nanocomposite structures with planar superlattice (SL), embedded nanowire superlattice (NWSL), and embedded nanodot superlattice (NDSL) geometries. Importantly, it is found that any of these three types of thin period systems, with small amounts of interface mass smudging, can exhibit a room-temperature conductivity significantly lower than the SiGe alloy conductivity, providing strong evidence that they could be used as efficient thermoelectric materials. It is also found that the room-temperature conductivity of each of the nanocomposite superlattices shows a weaker sample size dependence than do the component bulk conductivities.",3
Probing the magnetoelectric effect in noncentrosymmetric superconductors by equal-spin Andreev tunneling.,"In noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs), the conversion of a charge current into spin magnetization-the so called magnetoelectric effect-is the direct indicator of the unconventional, mixed-parity order parameter. This paper proposes a scheme to detect the magnetoelectric effect by anomalous, equal-spin Andreev tunneling in NCS/ferromagnet contacts. The proposal relies on the ability to generate spin-polarized triplet pairing by passing an electric current through an NCS. Such an induced triplet pairing bears a similarity to the paradigmatic nonunitary pairing in triplet superfluids with a complex vector order parameter [Formula: see text]. The qualitative difference is that the induced nonunitary state can be realised in NCSs with a purely real [Formula: see text] by breaking the time-reversal symmetry in current-biased setups. This offers a possibility to access the unconventional superconductivity in NCSs through electrical transport measurements.",3
Computational design of metal-supported molecular switches: transient ion formation during light- and electron-induced isomerisation of azobenzene.,"In molecular nanotechnology, a single molecule is envisioned to act as the basic building block of electronic devices. Such devices may be of special interest for organic photovoltaics, data storage, and smart materials. However, more often than not the molecular function is quenched upon contact with a conducting support. Trial-and-error-based decoupling strategies via molecular functionalisation and change of substrate have in many instances proven to yield unpredictable results. The adsorbate-substrate interactions that govern the function can be understood with the help of first-principles simulation. Employing dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (DFT) and linear expansion delta-self-consistent-field DFT, the electronic structure of a prototypical surface-adsorbed functional molecule, namely azobenzene adsorbed to (1 1 1) single crystal facets of copper, silver and gold, is investigated and the main reasons for the loss or survival of the switching function upon adsorption are identified. The light-induced switching ability of a functionalised derivative of azobenzene on Au(1 1 1) and azobenzene on Ag(1 1 1) and Au(1 1 1) is assessed based on the excited-state potential energy landscapes of their transient molecular ions, which are believed to be the main intermediates of the experimentally observed isomerisation reaction. We provide a rationalisation of the experimentally observed function or lack thereof that connects to the underlying chemistry of the metal-surface interaction and provides insights into general design strategies for complex light-driven reactions at metal surfaces.",3
Li 1s core exciton in LiH studied by x-ray Raman scattering spectroscopy.,"The Li 1s core excitation spectra in LiH was studied by means of x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectroscopy in a wide range of momentum transfers q. The analysis of the near-edge region of the measured spectra in combination with q-dependent ab initio calculations of XRS spectra based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) reveals that the prominent peak at the excitation onset arises from two main contributions, namely a pre-edge peak associated to a p-type core exciton and strong transitions to empty states near the bottom of the conduction band, which is in contrast to previous experimental studies that attributed that feature to a single excitonic peak. The p-like angular symmetry of the core exciton is supported by BSE calculations of the relative contributions to the XRS spectra from monopole and dipole transitions and by the observed decrease of its normalised intensity for increasing momentum transfers. Higher energy spectral features in the measured XRS spectra are well reproduced by BSE, as well as by real-space multiple-scattering calculations.",3
"Density functional theory study of structural and thermodynamical stabilities of ferromagnetic MnX (X = P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds.","Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for deriving enthalpies of formation [Formula: see text] H for ferromagnetic MnX (X [Formula: see text] P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds were made for the two competing structures, hexagonal [Formula: see text] and orthorhombic [Formula: see text]. Standard calculations were performed by using pseudopotentials with the generalized-gradient-approximation (PBE) as exchange-correlation functional. Enhanced exchange-correlation interactions were included by making use of a so-called DFT[Formula: see text]U approach which requires [Formula: see text] as a parameter. Application of PBE potentials for all compounds and elementary phases (all-PBE) resulted in negative values of [Formula: see text] H for MnP and MnAs in both structures whereby the result for MnP [Formula: see text] agrees very well with experiment. For MnSb and MnBi the all-PBE calculation gives a positive nonbonding [Formula: see text] H disagreeing with experiment. To overcome this discrepancy for MnSb and MnBi a DFT[Formula: see text]U ansatz was employed for all compounds and elemental Mn. The values for [Formula: see text] ranging between 0.7 for MnBi and 1.4 eV for MnAs were determined by fitting the DFT results to measured data of [Formula: see text] H. As a reference for pure Mn the [Formula: see text]-Mn phase was taken with [Formula: see text] eV by which choice the experimental volume is fitted. Atomic volumes and ionicities were derived applying Bader's concept resulting in ionicities of Mn less than [Formula: see text].",3
"Vibrational properties of germanane and fluorinated germanene in the chair, boat, and zigzag-line configurations.","The electronic and vibrational properties of germanane and fluorinated germanene are studied within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory frameworks. Different structural configurations of germanane and fluorinated germanene are investigated. The energy difference between the different configurations are consistently smaller than the energy of thermal fluctuations for all the analyzed DFT functionals LDA, GGA, and hybrid functionals, which implies that, in principle, it is possible to find these different configurations in different regions of the sample as minority phases or local defects. We calculate the Raman and infrared spectra for these configurations by using ab initio calculations and compare it with available experimental spectra for germanane. Our results show the presence of minority phases compatible with the configurations analyzed in this work. As these low energy configurations are metastable the present work shows that the synthesis of these energy competing phases is feasible by selectively changing the synthesis conditions, which is an opportunity to expand in this way the availability of new two-dimensional compounds.",3
Electronic properties of hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor pn-junctions.,"Hybrid inorganic/organic semiconductor heterojunctions are candidates to expand the scope of purely organic or inorganic junctions in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Comprehensive understanding of bulk and interface doping on the junction's electronic properties is therefore desirable. In this work, we elucidate the energy level alignment and its mechanisms at a prototypical hybrid pn-junction comprising ZnO (n-type) and p-doped N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (alpha-NPD) as semiconductors, using photoelectron spectroscopy. The level alignment can be quantitatively described by the interplay of contact-induced band and energy level bending in the inorganic and organic component away from the interface, and an interface dipole due to the push-back effect. By adjusting the dopant concentration in alpha-NPD, the position of the frontier energy levels of ZnO can be varied by over 0.5 eV and that of alpha-NPD by over 1 eV. The tunability of this pn-junction's energy levels evidences the substantial potential of the hybrid approach for enhancing device functionality.",3
Critical diffusivity in the reversibility-irreversibility transition of amorphous solids under oscillatory shear.,"Recently it was shown that under oscillatory shear at zero temperature an amorphous solid transitions from asymptotically periodic to asymptotically diffusive steady-state at a critical maximal strain amplitude. Current understanding of the physics behind this transition is lacking. Here we show, using computer simulations, evidence that the diffusivity of the vector of coordinates of the particles comprising an amorphous solid, when subject to oscillatory shear, undergoes a second order phase transition at the reversibility-irreversibility transition point. We explain how such a transition is consistent with dissipative forced dynamics on a complex energy landscape, such as is known to exist in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that as the forcing increases, more and more state-space volume becomes accessible to the system, making it less probable for the state-space trajectory of the system to self-intersect and form a limit-cycle, which explains the slowing-down observed at the transition.",3
Formation of Si/organic interfaces using alkyne-functionalized cyclooctynes-precursor-mediated adsorption of linear alkynes versus direct adsorption of cyclooctyne on Si(0 0 1).,"Adsorption of ethynyl-cyclopropyl-cyclooctyne (ECCO), an alkyne-functionalized cyclooctyne, on Si(0 0 1) was studied by means of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Together, XPS and STM results clearly indicate chemoselective adsorption of ECCO on Si(0 0 1) via a [2+2] cycloaddition of the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne without reaction of the ethynyl group. The results are compared to the adsorption of acetylene on Si(0 0 1): C2H2 adsorbs on Si(0 0 1) via a precursor-mediated reaction channel as it was shown by means of temperature dependent measurements of the sticking probability as well as by means of STM experiments at variable temperature. On the other hand, cyclooctyne adsorbs on Si(0 0 1) via a direct reaction channel. This qualitative difference in the reaction pathways of the two functionalities leads to the observed chemoselective adsorption of ECCO via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. As the ethynyl group stays intact, monolayers of ECCO on Si(0 0 1) form a well defined interface between the silicon substrate and further organic molecular layers which can be attached to the ethynyl functionality.",3
Thermodynamic limits to energy conversion in solar thermal fuels.,"Solar thermal fuels (STFs) are an unconventional paradigm for solar energy conversion and storage which is attracting renewed attention. In this concept, a material absorbs sunlight and stores the energy chemically via an induced structural change, which can later be reversed to release the energy as heat. An example is the azobenzene molecule which has a cis-trans photoisomerization with these properties, and can be tuned by chemical substitution and attachment to templates such as carbon nanotubes, small molecules, or polymers. By analogy to the Shockley-Queisser limit for photovoltaics, we analyze the maximum attainable efficiency for STFs from fundamental thermodynamic considerations. Microscopic reversibility provides a bound on the quantum yield of photoisomerization due to fluorescence, regardless of details of photochemistry. We emphasize the importance of analyzing the free energy, not just enthalpy, of the metastable molecules, and find an efficiency limit for conversion to stored chemical energy equal to the Shockley-Queisser limit. STF candidates from a recent high-throughput search are analyzed in light of the efficiency limit.",3
Magnetic properties of oxygen doped samarium clusters.,"Here we present the results of experimental study of magnetic properties of samarium clusters doped with a single oxygen atom. In a recent theoretical study it was observed that for pure Sm clusters a transition from fully non-magnetic to weakly magnetic occurs due to a valence change occurring at a size of eight atoms. Here we found, first, that pure Sm clusters could not be synthesized due to the strong oxidation tendency of Sm and the inability to sufficiently remove oxygen from the setup. Therefore, we studied Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters. Since the oxygen contributes to the binding, the valence transition for Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters may be expected to occur for a smaller cluster size than for pure Sm clusters. Indeed from our experiments the valence transition is indicated to occur for [Formula: see text] Sm atoms instead of [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, the observed magnetic moment as function of cluster size for Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters shows a strong dependency of the magnetic moment on the cluster size. A large total magnetic moment is observed for Sm[Formula: see text]O, Sm[Formula: see text]O, Sm[Formula: see text]O and Sm[Formula: see text]O compared to the smaller moment for Sm[Formula: see text]O to Sm[Formula: see text]O and Sm[Formula: see text]O to Sm[Formula: see text]O.",3
Component manipulated magnetic anisotropy and damping in Heusler-like compound Co2+x Fe1-x Al.,"The component dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the damping has been investigated in epitaxial Heusler-like compound Co2+x Fe1-x Al films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with x = -0.4, -0.2, 0, 0.2, and 0.4. All the films show a component tunable four-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy with the easy axis along [1 1 0] orientation. The time resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements reveal that the damping constant can be tuned in a range of 0.0065-0.0156 with a minimum value of 0.0065 at x = -0.2. This work provides a new approach to manipulate the magnetic dynamic properties of Heusler alloy Co2FeAl by adjusting the proportion of Co and Fe.",3
Thermal echo in a finite one-dimensional harmonic crystal.,"An instant homogeneous thermal perturbation in the finite harmonic one-dimensional crystal is studied. Previously it was shown that for the same problem in the infinite crystal the kinetic temperature oscillates with decreasing amplitude described by the Bessel function of the first kind. In the present paper it is shown that in the finite crystal this behavior is observed only until a certain period of time when a sharp increase of the oscillation amplitude is realized. This phenomenon, further referred to as the thermal echo, occurs periodically, with the period proportional to the crystal length. The amplitude for each subsequent echo is lower than for the previous one. It is obtained analytically that the time-dependence of the kinetic temperature can be described by an infinite sum of the Bessel functions with multiple indices. It is also shown that the thermal echo in the thermodynamic limit is described by the Airy function.",3
Shape deformation of a vesicle under an axisymmetric non-uniform alternating electric field.,"We suggest that non-uniform electric fields that are commonly used to study vesicle dielectrophoresis can be employed in hitherto relatively unexplored areas of vesicle deformation (for electromechanical characterization) and electroporation. Conventionally, the tension generated in vesicles is commonly modeled to be entropic or enthalpic in origin. A comparison of the configuration of a vesicle in the enthalpic and entropic regimes as well as the cross over between the two regimes during vesicle deformation has eluded understanding. A lucid demonstration of this concept is provided by the study of vesicle deformation under axisymmetric quadrupole electric field and the shapes of the vesicles obtained using the entropic and the enthalpic approaches, show significant differences. A strong dependence of the final vesicle shapes on the ratio of electrical conductivities of the fluids inside and outside the vesicle as well as on the frequency of the applied quadrupole electric field is observed. A comparison with experimental data from the literature is also made. Moreover, an excess area dependent transition between the entropic and enthalpic regimes is observed. The method could be used to estimate electromechanical properties of the vesicle.",3
Local insight into the La-induced structural phase transition in multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramics by x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy.,"Substitution of bismuth by rare earth (RE) ions is of great technological importance to develop room-temperature BiFeO3-based multiferroic materials. Despite this interest, many fundamental properties and the structure-property correlations of RE-doped BiFeO3 remain poorly understood. Here we report a systematical experimental and theoretical exploration on the structural phase transition in Bi1-x La x FeO3 (0 x 0.2) ceramics. By using x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, we for the first time show that the La(3+) dopants in fact substitute the Bi site of secondary nanosized particles with orthorhombic Pbam symmetry instead of the long-believed parental rhombohedral R3c phase at all La(3+) doping concentrations (0.001 x 0.2). This homogeneously mixed two-phase compound cannot be detected by the x-ray diffraction until La content approaching x = 0.1. The finding is further supported by complementary studies of transmission electron microscopy and thermodynamic preference, and it casts serious challenges on the prevailing assumption of La(3+) substitution on the Bi(3+) site in R3c structure when x 0.1 as well as the previously proposed origin of enhanced functional properties based on morphotropic phase boundary. This new insight may ignite a revival on exploring the underlying multiferroic mechanisms in BiFeO3-based materials and facilitate the bottom-up design of novel multifunctional devices.",3
Orbiton-phonon coupling in Ir(5+)(5d (4)) double perovskite Ba2YIrO6.,"Ba2YIrO6, a Mott insulator, with four valence electrons in Ir(5+) d-shell (5d (4)) is supposed to be non-magnetic, with J eff = 0, within the atomic physics picture. However, recent suggestions of non-zero magnetism have raised some fundamental questions about its origin. We focus on the phonon dynamics, probed via Raman scattering, as a function of temperature and different incident photon energies, as an external perturbation. Our studies reveal strong renormalization of the phonon self-energy parameters and integrated intensity for first-order modes, especially redshift of the few first-order modes with decreasing temperature and anomalous softening of modes associated with IrO6 octahedra, as well as high energy Raman bands attributed to the strong anharmonic phonons and coupling with orbital excitations. The distinct renormalization of second-order Raman bands with respect to their first-order counterpart suggest that higher energy Raman bands have significant contribution from orbital excitations. Our observation indicates that strong anharmonic phonons coupled with electronic/orbital degrees of freedom provides a knob for tuning the conventional electronic levels for 5d-orbitals, and this may give rise to non-zero magnetism as postulated in recent theoretical calculations with rich magnetic phases.",3
"Structural, elastic and vibrational properties of celestite, SrSO4, from synchrotron x-ray diffraction, thermal diffuse scattering and Raman scattering.","In order to resolve inconsistencies encountered in published data for SrSO[Formula: see text], the elasticity and the phase stability of celestite has been studied using thermal diffuse scattering, high pressure powder synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman scattering and DFT calculations. The structure of SrSO[Formula: see text] is found to be stable up to 62 GPa at ambient temperature. The preferred values for the components of the elastic stiffness tensor have been determined using x-ray thermal diffuse scattering and are (in GPa): [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]. The preferred value for the bulk modulus is [Formula: see text] GPa. This work shows that thermal diffuse scattering collected at two temperatures allows the determination of the full elastic tensor of crystals with low space group symmetry.",3
Emergence of topological phases by stacking of two-dimensional lattices with nonsymmorphic symmetry.,"Topological semimetals have a variety of phases, whose Fermi surfaces can be nodal points, nodal lines and nodal loops. Here we construct four classes of 3D minimal models via vertically stacking a 2D nonsymmorphic lattice with and without breaking crystalline symmetries. As a result, four distinct topological phases can be generated in our minimal model, such as Dirac nodal line semimetals, Weyl nodal line semimetals, unconventional Weyl semimetals with topological charge [Formula: see text], and weak topological insulators. Unexpectedly, Weyl nodal loops are generated without mirror symmetry protection, where nontrivial 'drumhead' surface states emerge within the loops.",3
Transport characteristics and dwell time in a bilayer phosphorene barrier.,"In this paper, transport properties, dwell time and electron conductance were theoretically investigated through a rectangular electrostatic potential barrier in bilayer phosphorene and compared the results with monolayer phosphorene and graphene. It has been shown that in bilayer phosphorene, in the presence of an interlayer induced bias, a four-band approximation describes transport process in the system. The results show that interlayer bias parameter drastically affect transport properties. These effects include: (1) appearance of eight transmission and reflection coefficients from a band within the same band and between the two bands; (2) appearance of the anti-Klein tunnelling phenomenon and tuning the bias of system in such a way which is observed in specified biases and removed in other biases; (3) tuning conductance of the system. Results of dwell time in bilayer phosphorene show that this parameter in terms of barrier thickness does not have a strictly ascending behaviour and in limited range of incident energies (incident angles), the dwell time in the barrier reduces significantly which can be exploited in designing switching devices in nano-electronics. We found that increasing the interlayer bias decreases the intrinsic gap of the bilayer phosphorene which enables us to control the electron transmission rate in the system. In addition, our findings also demonstrate that by tuning the interlayer bias, a large electrical conductance can be achieved which can be used in semiconductor technology. Our study could serve as a basis for investigations of the basic physics of tunnelling mechanisms and using bilayer phosphorene as a proper candidate in low dimensional semiconductor industry.",3
Hybridization of an unoccupied molecular orbital with an image potential state at a lead phthalocyanine/graphite interface.,"The interaction of a molecular orbital with a surface state is important to understand the spatial distribution of the wave function at the molecule/substrate interface. In this study, we focus on hybridization of an unoccupied state of lead phthalocyanine (PbPc) with the image potential state (IPS) on a graphite surface. The hybridization modifies the energy-momentum dispersions of the IPS on PbPc films as observed by angle-resolved two-photon photoemission. On the PbPc 1 monolayer film, the IPS band forms a band gap and back-folding appears at the first Brillouin zone boundary due to the periodic potential by the adsorbate lattice. The modification of the dispersion is accompanied by the intensity enhancement of the IPS. We attributed the origin of the modified dispersion and intensity enhancement to a hybridization of the IPS with a molecule-derived unoccupied level. From the photon energy-dependent measurement on multilayer films, we have found the diffuse unoccupied molecular level in the vicinity of the IPS. The tail part of the IPS wave function in the substrate is enhanced by the hybridization with the unoccupied state, and thus strengthens the transition from the occupied substrate band to the hybridized IPS.",3
Magnetic impurity resonance states for different pairing symmetries in twisted bilayer graphene.,"In this work, we study the magnetic impurity resonance states in the superconducting phase of 'magic' angle twisted bilayer graphene for different pairing symmetries. Using a two-orbital model on the emergent honeycomb lattice, we find that the resonance states are dramatically different for [Formula: see text]-wave pairing and topological nontrivial pairings. When the magnetic impurity is located at one site of the emergent honeycomb lattice, i.e. the center of the AB spot of the moire pattern, the spacial distributions of the resonance states will break both the threefold and twofold rotation symmetries of [Formula: see text] point group for pairing symmetries which belong to the irreducible representations of this point group. When the magnetic impurity is located at the center of the emergent honeycomb lattice i.e. the center of the AA spot of the moire pattern, the appearance of resonance peak at the position close to the impurity can be considered as a strong evidence of non-[Formula: see text]-wave pairing.",3
Flexibility defines structure in crystals of amphiphilic DNA nanostars.,"DNA nanostructures with programmable shape and interactions can be used as building blocks for the self-assembly of crystalline materials with prescribed nanoscale features, holding a vast technological potential. Structural rigidity and bond directionality have been recognised as key design features for DNA motifs to sustain long-range order in 3D, but the practical challenges associated with prescribing building-block geometry with sufficient accuracy have limited the variety of available designs. We have recently introduced a novel platform for the one-pot preparation of crystalline DNA frameworks supported by a combination of Watson-Crick base pairing and hydrophobic forces (Brady et al 2017 Nano Lett. 17 3276-81). Here we use small angle x-ray scattering and coarse-grained molecular simulations to demonstrate that, as opposed to available all-DNA approaches, amphiphilic motifs do not rely on structural rigidity to support long-range order. Instead, the flexibility of amphiphilic DNA building-blocks is a crucial feature for successful crystallisation.",3
"First-principles study of thermal expansion and thermomechanics of group-V monolayers: blue phosphorene, arsenene, and antimonene.","Using first-principles calculations based on quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), we systematically investigate the vibrational properties, thermal expansion and thermomechanics properties of three monoatomic group-V monolayers with honeycomb structure: blue phosphorene, arsenene and antimonene. It is found antimonene shows negative thermal expansion in the temperature range studied, while blue phosphorene and arsenene display small positive thermal expansion at high temperature. The physical mechanisms of their different thermal properties are explored. The results of Gruneisen theory are also exhibited for comparison, and the similarities and differences are studied. It is concluded the discrepancies arise from the high order anharmonicity of phonons.",3
Inter-node superconductivity in strained Weyl semimetals.,"The effects of a strain-induced pseudomagnetic field on inter-node spin-triplet superconducting states in Weyl semimetals are studied by using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism. It is found that the Cooper pairing with spins parallel to the pseudomagnetic field has the lowest energy among the spin-triplet states and its gap does not depend on the strength of the field. In such a state, both electric and chiral superconducting currents are absent. This is in contrast to the superconducting states with the spins of Cooper pairs normal to the field, which support a nonzero chiral current and are inhibited by the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. The corresponding critical value of the field, which separates the normal and superconducting phases, is estimated.",3
Size and shape dependent melting temperature of metallic nanomaterials.,"This study aims to characterize the size and shape dependent melting temperature of nanomaterials. Considering that surface atoms and interior atoms affect the melting of materials in different manners, we thus define an equivalent relationship between the contribution of surface atoms and interior atoms. Based on this definition, a criterion of melting is proposed through introducing a critical energy storage density of melting, the sum of the contribution of surface atoms and the interior atoms. According to the proposed criterion, a new theoretical model without any adjustable parameters is developed to characterize the size effect of melting temperatures of nanomaterials. The model predictions are in good agreement with the available experimental data or molecular dynamics simulations. This model uncovers the quantitative relationship between the melting temperature, size, atomic diameter and shape of nanomaterials. In addition, this model is extended to predict the size dependent glass transition temperatures of polymers. This study can help to better understand and characterize the size dependent melting temperatures of nanomaterials, as well as the size dependent glass transition temperatures of polymers.",3
First-principles investigation of the interface magnetic anisotropy of Fe/SrTiO3.,"Interface effects in magnetic nanostructures play a critical role in the magnetic properties. By using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of Fe/SrTiO3 interfaces, in which both the nonpolar surface SrTiO3(0 0 1) and the polar surface SrTiO3(1 1 0) are considered. A particular emphasis is placed on the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Comparing MAE of the Fe/SrTiO3 interfaces and the corresponding Fe monolayers, we find the Fe/SrTiO3(0 0 1) interface decreases MAE, while the Fe/SrTiO3(1 1 0) interface increases MAE. The interface orbital hybridization and orbital magnetic moments are analyzed in detail to understand the different interface magnetic anisotropy. Our investigation indicates that interface engineering can be an effective way to modulate the magnetic properties.",3
Electronic structure of an iron porphyrin derivative on Au(1 1 1).,"Surface-bound porphyrins are promising candidates for molecular switches, electronics and spintronics. Here, we studied the structural and the electronic properties of Fe-tetra-pyridil-porphyrin adsorbed on Au(1 1 1) in the monolayer regime. We combined scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission, and two-photon photoemission to determine the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals. We also resolved an excitonic state with a binding energy of 420 meV, which allowed us to compare the electronic transport gap with the optical gap.",3
Distortions in the cubic primitive high-pressure phases of calcium.,"The superconductivity in highly compressed calcium involves the occurrence of closely related low-symmetry structural patterns with an exceptionally low coordination number. Earlier theoretical and experimental results are controversial and some findings are inconsistent with our later observations in the pressure range up to 60 GPa. This situation motivated the present concerted computational and experimental re-investigation of the structural arrangement of calcium slightly above the high-pressure limit of the bcc arrangement at low-temperatures. We report here reproducible experimental evidence for a monoclinic distortion (mC4, space group C2/c) of the calcium polymorph previously assigned to the tetragonal beta-Sn structure type. In accordance, the enthalpies calculated by electronic band structure calculations show the mC4 phase to be more stable than the undistorted beta-Sn type by about 100 meV in the entire phase space. The other low-temperature phase of calcium adopts space group Cmcm (oC4) rather than the earlier assigned Cmmm symmetry. These structural alterations substantially effect the density of states at the Fermi level and, thus, the electronic properties.",3
Scattering characteristics of an exciton-plasmon nanohybrid made by coupling a monolayer graphene nanoflake to a carbon nanotube.,"A hybrid nanostructure where a graphene nanoflake (GNF) is optically coupled to a carbon nanotube (CNT) could potentially possess enhanced sensing capabilities compared to the individual constituents whilst inheriting their high biocompatibility, favourable electrical, mechanical and spectroscopic properties. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the scattering characteristics of an all-carbon exciton-plasmon nanohybrid which was made by coupling an elliptical GNF resonator to a semiconducting CNT gain element. We analytically model the nanohybrid as an open quantum system using cavity quantum electrodynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the dipole moment operator and the dipole response field of the GNF and characterize the Rayleigh scattering spectrum of the nanohybrid. These analytical expressions are valid for any arbitrary ellipsoidal nanoresonator coupled to a quantum emitter. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis, the results of which indicate that the GNF-CNT nanohybrid exhibits enhanced and versatile scattering capabilities compared to the individual constituents. We show that the spectral signatures of the nanohybrid are highly tunable using a multitude of system parameters such as Fermi energy of the GNF, component dimensions, GNF-CNT separation distance and the permittivity of the submerging medium. We finally demonstrate the prospect of using the proposed nanohybrid to reconstruct the permittivity profile of a tumour. The high biocompatibility and high sensitivity to the dielectric properties of the environment make the proposed GNF-CNT nanohybrid an ideal candidate for such biosensing applications.",3
Coherent optical and acoustic phonons generated at lattice-matched GaP/Si(0 0 1) heterointerfaces.,"Thin GaP films can be grown on an exact Si(0 0 1) substrate with nearly perfect lattice match. We perform all-optical pump-probe measurements to investigate the ultrafast electron-phonon coupling at the buried interface of GaP/Si. Above-bandgap excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse can induce coherent longitudinal optical (LO) phonons both in the GaP overlayer and in the Si substrate. The coupling of the GaP LO phonons with photoexcited plasma is reduced significantly with decreasing GaP layer thickness from 56 to 16 nm due to the quasi-two-dimensional confinement of the plasma. The same laser pulse can also generate coherent longitudinal acoustic phonons in the form of a strain pulse. The strain pulse induces not only a periodic modulation in the optical reflectivity as it propagates in the semiconductor, but also a sharp spike when it arrives at the GaP layer boundary. The acoustic pulse induced at the GaP/Si interface is remarkably stronger than that at the Si surface, suggesting a possible application of the GaP/Si heterostructure as an opto-acoustic transducer. The amplitude and the phase of the reflectivity modulation varies with the GaP layer thickness, which can be understood in terms of the interference caused by the multiple acoustic pulses generated at the top surface and at the buried interface.",3
Effect of the anchoring strength on the phase behaviour of discotic liquid crystals under face-on confinement.,"In this study we have performed molecular dynamics simulations to study a Gay-Berne discotic fluid confined in a slab geometry for a fixed confinement length. Four different anchoring strengths with a homeotropic (face-on) configuration were studied. We found that changing the anchoring strength changes the normal component of the stress tensor, which in turn changes the density of the system's bulk. This phenomenon leads to a shift in the isotropic-nematic transition temperature. We observe that the temperature regions where the nematic phase is present diminishes as the anchoring strength increases. The anchoring strength also affects the nematic-columnar coexistence temperature-region: it spans over more temperatures at higher anchoring strengths.",3
Optimal phase space sampling for Monte Carlo simulations of Heisenberg spin systems.,"We present an adaptive algorithm for the optimal phase space sampling in Monte Carlo simulations of 3D Heisenberg spin systems. Based on a golden rule of the Metropolis algorithm which states that an acceptance rate of [Formula: see text] is ideal to efficiently sample the phase space, the algorithm adaptively modifies a cone-based spin update method keeping the acceptance rate close to [Formula: see text]. We have assessed the efficiency of the adaptive algorithm through four different tests and contrasted its performance with that of other common spin update methods. In systems at low and high temperatures and anisotropies, the adaptive algorithm proved to be the most efficient for magnetization reversal and for the convergence to equilibrium of the thermal averages and the coercivity in hysteresis calculations. Thus, the adaptive algorithm can be used to significantly reduce the computational cost in Monte Carlo simulations of 3D Heisenberg spin systems.",3
Effect of pressure on the physical properties of the superconductor NiBi3.,"We present an experimental study of the superconducting properties of NiBi3 as a function of pressure by means of resistivity and magnetization measurements and combine our results with density functional theory calculations of the band structure under pressure. We find a moderate suppression of the critical temperature [Formula: see text] from [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] K to [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] K by pressures up to 2 GPa. By taking into account the change of the band structure as a function of pressure, we argue that the decrease in [Formula: see text] is consistent with conventional, electron-phonon-mediated BCS-type superconductivity.",3
Melting of bcc crystal Ta without the Lindemann criterion.,"Understanding of melting is deeply rooted in the Lindemann criterion which predicts that the transition occurs when the mean vibrational atomic displacement reaches a universal value. The criterion also finds its way in atomic description of kinetics of various structural phase transitions involving liquid and amorphous phases. Here we show using atomistic modeling in bcc crystal tantalum that neither the universal displacement exists nor melting occurs at the anticipated value from the Lindemann criterion. Instead, before and at melting a series of strongly correlated atomic diffusional motions are set in with the atomic displacement far more complicated than that predicted by Lindemann based on independent atomic vibrations. The displacement leads to formation of new extended atomic configurations composed of lattice chains and loops of Ta atoms still residing on the crystal lattice. It is the proliferation of these lattice chains that leads to melting.",3
"Failure mode in first-principles computational tensile tests of grain boundaries: effects of a bulk-region size, dominant factors, and local-energy and local-stress analysis.","A first-principles computational tensile test (FPCTT) is a powerful tool to investigate intrinsic strength and failure processes of grain boundaries (GBs), according to atomic and electronic behaviors based on density-functional theory, while careful interpretation is required in comparison with experiments, because of ideal conditions used in FPCTTs. We observed serious effects of a bulk-region size in FPCTTs of the {0 0 1} [Formula: see text]5 GB in Al. For a GB supercell with enough thick bulk regions, the energy-strain curve shows spontaneous failure with catastrophic energy release just after the maximum stress point, which we name Type-A failure. For a GB supercell with thin bulk regions, the energy increases gradually even after the maximum stress and continuously becomes that of relaxed fracture surfaces, which we name Type-B failure, although the stress-strain curves are almost common until the maximum stress point in both the supercells. The peculiar failure of Type B occurs by the lack of accumulated strain energies for creating fracture surfaces even after the maximum stress point, because the accumulated strain energy is nearly proportional to the bulk-region size. We clarified that the failure mode in a FPCTT depends on the relationship among the three factors; the accumulated strain energy depending on the bulk-region size, the work of separation (the formation energy of fractured surfaces into a GB), and the maximum stress of the GB (the GB strength). We showed that the failure mode of previous FPCTTs of Al tilt GBs with segregated impurities can be reinterpreted from this viewpoint, by considering the changes of the work of separation and the GB strength by impurities. We should be aware of the distinction of the failure mode in FPCTTs, because experimentally Type-B failure does not occur except for special cases. Finally, we applied ab initio local-energy and local-stress analysis to the FPCTT of the {0 0 1} [Formula: see text]5 GB in Al, and discussed how to extract local energy-strain or energy-separation relations independent of the bulk-region size to be combined with meso- or macroscopic simulations.",3
"Disclosing odd symmetry, strain driven magnetic response of Co on Pt/PMN-PT (0 1 1).","An odd-symmetry magnetic response of multiferroic composites comprising ultrathin Co layers on Pt electrodes on [Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3](1-x)[PbTiO3] x (PMN-PT) (0 1 1) piezoelectric substrates is observed upon electrical poling of the PMN-PT substrates: the magnetic easy axis of the Co rotates by 90 degrees in-plane between oppositely poled ferroelectric states, mimicking the signature of a surface polarization charge driven effect, which however can be excluded from the presence of the thick Pt interlayer. The origin for this unexpected behavior is as an odd symmetry piezoelectric response of the PMN-PT substrate, as indicated by x-ray diffraction with applied poling, in combination with conventional magnetoelastic coupling. Ferroelectric characterization reveals corresponding features, possibly related to an unswitchable polarization component.",3
Comparing two high correlation models to test the mechanical stability of americium-II.,"In this work two high density functional theory (DFT) correlation methodologies, the so called DFT+U (or GGA+U) implementation and the exact exchange of correlated electrons (EECE), hybrid DFT functional (or one case of hybrid DFT), are tested to determine the mechanical properties of americium-II. For each case, the numeric value of their principal parameter is chosen ([Formula: see text] for the first case and [Formula: see text] for the second one) once the crystalline structure meets all the mechanical stability conditions. The results show that there is a range of values of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in which both methodologies generate a stable (experimentally correct) non-magnetic ground state, reaching approximately the same numeric value of the set of elastic constants of the cubic structure. However, only for the case of the hybrid functional results it is possible to show how the non-magnetic configuration is energetically favored, as compared to the ferromagnetic configuration. This happens around [Formula: see text], a value in agreement with a previous analysis made under the same methodology for the metal case Am-I. Following a detailed and deep analysis, it is possible to find a close interrelation between the electronic properties of the metal: its distribution of states around the Fermi level, the energy difference between the two possible spin configurations, and the mechanical response of the crystal. Also, it is possible to conclude that the effect of alpha parameter on the [Formula: see text] electrons can be used as a parameter to simulate the presence of an external pressure over the structure. For the comparison, the calculations were performed within the LAPW approximation in DFT as implemented in the WIEN2k code, with a finite deformation method.",3
Ferromagnetism in graphene traced to antisymmetric orbital combination of involved electronic states.,"Based on first principles calculations, we reveal that the origin of ferromagnetism caused by [Formula: see text] electrons in graphene with vacancies can be traced to electrons partially filling [Formula: see text]-antibonding and [Formula: see text]-nonbonding states, which are induced by the vacancies and appear near the Fermi level. Because the spatial wavefunctions of both states are composed of atomic orbitals in an antisymmetric configuration, their spin wavefunctions should be symmetric according to the electron exchange antisymmetric principle, leading to electrons partially filling these states in spin polarization. Since this [Formula: see text] state originates not from interactions between the atoms but from the unpaired [Formula: see text] orbitals due to the removal of [Formula: see text] orbitals on the minority sublattice, the [Formula: see text] state is constrained, distributed on the atoms of the majority sublattice, and decays gradually from the vacancy as approximately [Formula: see text]. According to these characteristics, we concluded that the [Formula: see text] state plays a critical role in magnetic ordering in graphene with vacancies. If the vacancy concentration in graphene is large enough to cause the decay-length regions to overlap, constraining the [Formula: see text] orbital components as little as possible on the minority sublattice atoms in the overlap regions results in the vacancy-induced [Formula: see text] states being coherent. The coherent process in the overlap region leads to the wavefunctions in all the involved regions antisymmetrized, consequently causing ferromagnetism according to the electron exchange antisymmetric principle. This unusual mechanism concerned with the origin of [Formula: see text]-electron magnetism and magnetic ordering has never before been reported and is distinctly different from conventional mechanisms. Consequently, we can explain how such a weak magnetization with such a high critical temperature can be experimentally observed in proton-irradiated graphene.",3
"Superconducting transition temperatures in the electronic and magnetic phase diagrams of Sr2VFeAsO3-delta , a superconductor.","We elucidate the magnetic phases and superconducting (SC) transition temperatures (T c) in Sr2VFeAsO3-delta (21113V), an iron-based superconductor with a thick-blocking layer fabricated from a perovskite-related transition metal oxide. At low temperatures (T < 37.1 K), 21113V exhibited a SC phase in the range 0.031 delta 0.145 and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) iron sublattice in the range 0.267 delta 0.664. Mixed-valent vanadium exhibited a dominant AFM phase in 0.031 delta 0.088, and a partial ferrimagnetic (Ferri.) phase in the range 0.124 delta 0.664. The Ferri. phase was the most dominant at a delta value of 0.267, showing an AFM phase of Fe at T < 20 K. Increasing the spontaneous magnetic moments reduced the magnetic shielding volume fraction due to the SC phase. This result was attributed to the magnetic phase of vanadium, which dominates the superconductivity of Fe in 21113V. The T c-delta curve showed two maxima. The smaller and larger of T c maxima occurred at delta = 0.073 and delta = 0.145, respectively; the latter resides on the phase boundary between AFM and the partial Ferri. phases of vanadium. 21113V is a useful platform for verifing new mechanisms of T c enhancement in iron-based superconductors.",3
High-pressure polymorphism of BaFe2Se3.,"BaFe2Se3 is a potential superconductor material exhibiting transition at 11 K and ambient pressure. Here we extended the structural and performed electrical resistivity measurements on this compound up to 51 GPa and 20 GPa, respectively, in order to distinguish if the superconductivity in this sample is intrinsic to the BaFe2Se3 phase or if it is originating from minor FeSe impurities that show a similar superconductive transition temperature. The electrical resistance measurements as a function of pressure show that at 5 GPa the superconducting transition is observed at around 10 K, similar to the one previously observed for this sample at ambient pressure. This indicates that the superconductivity in this sample is most likely intrinsic to the BaFe2Se3 phase and not to FeSe with T c > 20 K at these pressures. Further increase in pressure suppressed the superconductive signal and the sample remained in an insulating state up to the maximum achieved pressure of 20 GPa. Single-crystal and powder x-ray diffraction measurements revealed two structural transformations in BaFe2Se3: a second order transition above 3.5 GPa from Pnma (CsAg2I3-type structure) to Cmcm (CsCu2Cl3-type structure) and a first order transformation at 16.6 GPa. Here, gamma-BaFe2Se3 transforms into delta-BaFe2Se3 (Cmcm, CsCu2Cl3-type average structure) via a first order phase transition mechanism. This transition is characterized by a significant shortening of the b lattice parameter of gamma-BaFe2Se3 (17%) and accompanied by an anisotropic expansion in the orthogonal ac plane at the transition point.",3
First-principles prediction of two atomic-thin phosphorene allotropes with potentials for sun-light-driven water splitting.,"Based on first-principles, the structures, stabilities, electronic and optical properties of two new atomic-thin phosphorene allotropes, named as stair-P and zipper-P, are systematically investigated. Stair-P and zipper-P are constructed based on the previously proposed stair-graphane and zipper-graphane, respectively. They are confirmed to be dynamically stable phosphorene allotropes with energetic stabilities comparable to the experimentally synthesized black-P and blue-P. Stair-P and zipper-P are all semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 2.32 eV and 2.00 eV, respectively. These band gaps can be effectively modulated by in-layer compressive and stretching strains. The band edges of stair-P and zipper-P are proper for water splitting at both acidic (PH = 0) and neutral (PH = 7) environments and their sun-light adsorbing abilities are better than black-P and blue-P in the visible range.",3
Effect of wavefunction delocalization on shift current generation.,"We derive upper bounds on the magnitude of shift photocurrent generation of materials in two limiting cases: the flat-band limit of almost-isolated systems such as molecular crystals, and the wide-band limit of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional materials such as ferroelectric polymers or other materials with chain-like motifs. These bounds relate the magnitudes of the shift current bulk photovoltaic effect to materials parameters. In both cases, we find that ratio of electron hopping amplitudes to the band gap plays a vital role in maximizing the amount of nonlinear response. Furthermore, by using the Wannier function formalism, we quantify the effect of long-range hopping amplitudes, showing how delocalization of electronic states gives rise to larger photocurrents. These results inform the design and selection of new materials for large shift current generation.",3
Topological magnon insulator with a Kekule bond modulation.,"We examine the combined effects of a Kekule coupling texture (KC) and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice. By analyzing the gap closing conditions and the inversions of the bulk bands, we identify the parameter range in which the system behaves as a trivial or a nontrivial topological magnon insulator. We find four topological phases in terms of the KC parameter and the DMI strength. We present the bulk-edge correspondence for the magnons in a honeycomb lattice with an armchair or a zigzag boundary. Furthermore, we find Tamm-like edge states due to the intrinsic on-site interactions along the boundary sites. Our results may have significant implications to magnon transport properties in the 2D magnets at low temperatures.",3
A new constraint DFT technique for self-consistent determination of U values.,"A new constraint density functional (DFT) technique workable in combination with the projector augmented wave (PAW) and pseudoptential (PP) methods was developed. This technique calculates the effective on-site-interaction parameter, U eff, of correlated electrons of materials, self-consistently, by using the DFT + U method. The U eff determined by this technique has a clear physical meaning in that it determines the electronic structures of strongly correlated electronic systems (SCESs) and vice versa. The technique was used to determine the U eff of correlated electrons of neodymium sesquioxide (Nd2O3) and iron oxide (FeO), and it was shown to be effective for this purpose. It enables first principles DFT + U PAW and PP calculations of SCESs free from any empirical parameters.",3
Direct coupling of first-principles calculations with replica exchange Monte Carlo sampling of ion disorder in solids.,"We demonstrate the feasibility of performing sufficient configurational sampling of disordered oxides directly from first-principles without resorting to the use of fitted models such as cluster expansion. This is achieved by harnessing the power of modern-day cluster supercomputers using the replica exchange Monte Carlo method coupled directly with structural relaxation and energy calculation performed by density functional codes. The idea is applied successfully to the calculation of the temperature-dependence of the degree of inversion in the cation sublattice of MgAl2O4 spinel oxide. The possibility of bypassing fitting models will lead to investigation of disordered systems where cluster expansion is known to perform badly, for example, systems with large lattice deformation due to defects, or systems where long-range interactions dominate such as electrochemical interfaces.",3
Experimental and theoretical evidences for the ice regime in planar artificial spin ices.,"In this work, we explore a kind of geometrical effect in the thermodynamics of artificial spin ices (ASI). In general, such artificial materials are athermal. Here, We demonstrate that geometrically driven dynamics in ASI can open up the panorama of exploring distinct ground states and thermally magnetic monopole excitations. It is shown that a particular ASI lattice will provide a richer thermodynamics with nanomagnet spins experiencing less restriction to flip precisely in a kind of rhombic lattice. This can be observed by analysis of only three types of rectangular artificial spin ices (RASI). Denoting the horizontal and vertical lattice spacings by [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, then, a RASI material can be described by its aspect ratio [Formula: see text]. The rhombic lattice emerges when [Formula: see text]. So, by comparing the impact of thermal effects on the spin flips in these three appropriate different RASI arrays, it is possible to find a system very close to the ice regime.",3
Quasi-degenerate magnetic states in alpha-RuCl3.,"Exploring quantum spin liquid (QSL) state has both fundamental scientific value and realistic application potential. Recently, alpha-RuCl3 was experimentally observed to hold in-plane zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperature, which was further proposed to be proximate to a Kitaev QSL ground state. We have studied the magnetic properties of alpha-RuCl3 in the framework of electronic structure calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) and spin-orbit coupling. When the intra-orbital Hubbard interaction U and the inter-orbital Hund's coupling J adopt the commonly accepted values of U = 2.0 eV and J = 0.4 eV, the zigzag AFM order indeed owns the minimum energy, consistent with the experimental observation. More importantly, we find that compared with the ferromagnetic order in the previous theoretical studies, there exist a series of magnetic configurations energetically even closer to the zigzag AFM ground state. The further calculations and analysis indicate that these low-energy magnetic states are closely related to the electronic correlation effect of Ru 4d orbitals. By decreasing U and increasing J with just about 0.2 eV, they become energetically degenerate with the zigzag AFM order, inducing strong magnetic frustration and then yielding a state without long-range magnetic order but with nonzero local moments. Considering the facts that theoretically the pressure usually reduces the intra-orbital Hubbard interaction and meanwhile enhances the inter-orbital Hund's coupling, while experimentally the pressure drives alpha-RuCl3 into a quantum disordered phase, our results provide a perspective to understand the exotic magnetic behaviors of alpha-RuCl3.",3
3D surface condensation of large atomic shear strain in nanoscale metallic glasses under low uniaxial stress.,"Nanoscale metallic glasses (MGs) are frequently used in experimental and computational studies to probe the deformation mechanisms in amorphous metals. Potential consequences of the significant surface to volume ratio in these extremely small materials, nevertheless, are not well understood. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and novel selective 3D visualization, we show that significant irreversible atomic shear strain condenses on the 3D surface of these materials under low uniaxial stress, while the interior atoms are bearing much lower, mostly reversible shear strain. This is observed for various sample geometries, dimensions, strain rates and temperatures, and attributable to the correlations of atomic shear strain with atomic potential energy and coordination number. The results reveal the profound influence of the surface on the strain partitioning in nanoscale MGs across the 3D volume, critical to the initiation and continuation of plasticity.",3
"On the role of magnesium in a LiF:Mg,Ti thermoluminescent dosimeter.","LiF doped with Mg and Ti is the most widely used thermoluminescent (TL) dosimeter for a large variety of applications. It has been argued that the Mg dopant is the most important defect in the TL process. Besides the common F-centre defects in LiF, optical absorption measurements have suggested the presence of Mg-related absorption bands at 380 nm (3.26 eV), and 310 nm (4.0 eV) when LiF:Mg is exposed to ionizing radiation, whose origin is not yet well understood. This work presents an investigation of the role of defects induced by Mg interstitials in LiF through electronic structure calculations. The calculations show that Mg interstitials induce a local lattice distortion characterized by the displacement of two opposite fluorine atoms, adjacent to the magnesium, away from their original sites by an average distance of 0.6 A each, while the closest Li atoms are displaced by 0.1 A. This defect introduces electronic states in the band-gap that can trap excess electrons produced during irradiation, thus enhancing the efficiency of the detector. Holes, on the other hand, are created and trapped in orbitals of mainly Mg-3s character. Additionally, the results suggest that irradiation can simultaneously remove a Li atom nearby a Mg interstitial; substitute a Li by a Mg atom or create a Li vacancy plus a Mg substitutional, giving rise to defects within the LiF gap that are more stable thermodynamically than the Mg interstitial itself. Interestingly, under irradiation the energy levels obtained for LiF:Mg-Lisub + e (-) (3.486 eV) and LiF:Mg + e (-) (4.224 eV) defects are very close to the experimental absorption bands.",3
Ginzburg-Landau theory for the magnetic and structural transitions in La1-y (Ca1-x Sr x ) y MnO3.,"We present a phenomenological theory for the ferromagnetic transition temperature, the magnetic susceptibility at high temperatures, and the structural distortion in the La[Formula: see text](Ca[Formula: see text]Sr[Formula: see text])[Formula: see text]MnO[Formula: see text] system. We construct a Ginzburg-Landau free energy that describes the magnetic and the structural transitions, and a competition between them. The parameters of the magnetic part of the free energy are derived from a mean-field solution of the magnetic interaction for arbitrary angular momentum. The theory provides a qualitative description of the observed magnetic and structural phase transitions as functions of Sr-doping level ([Formula: see text]) for [Formula: see text].",3
Transverse and longitudinal spin-fluctuations in INVAR Fe0.65Ni0.35.,The presence of spin-fluctuations deep within the ordered state of ferromagnetic [Formula: see text] alloy [Formula: see text] has long been suspected but seldom directly observed. Inhomogeneities of one type or another have been cited as important in stabilizing [Formula: see text] behaviour-either longitudinal spin-fluctuations associated with the [Formula: see text]-state (local environment) model or transverse magnetisation arising from non-collinear spin structures. In this study we employ small-angle neutron scattering with neutron polarization analysis to distinguish between the two possibilities. Surprisingly we in fact find evidence of dominant but uncorrelated longitudinal spin-fluctuations coexisting with transverse magnetisation which exists in short-range clusters of size ~[Formula: see text]. This finding supports recent first principles calculations of [Formula: see text] in which both longitudinal spin-fluctuations and magnetic short-range order are identified as important ingredients in reproducing the equilibrium [Formula: see text] lattice.,3
Non-linear soft x-ray methods on solids with MUSIX-the multi-dimensional spectroscopy and inelastic x-ray scattering endstation.,"With the intense and coherent x-ray pulses available from free-electron lasers, the possibility to transfer non-linear spectroscopic methods from the laser lab to the x-ray world arises. Advantages especially regarding selectivity and thus information content as well as an improvement of signal levels are expected. The use of coherences is especially fruitful and the example of coherent x-ray/optical sum-frequency generation is discussed. However, many non-linear x-ray methods still await discovery, partially due to the necessity for extremely adaptable and versatile instrumentation that can be brought to free-electron lasers for the analysis of the spectral content emitted from the sample into a continuous range of emission angles. Such an instrument (called MUSIX) is being developed and employed at FLASH, the free-electron laser in Hamburg and is described in this contribution together with first results.",3
Half-metallicity in uranium intermetallics: crystal structure prediction of a high-pressure phase of UCo.,Evolutionary crystal structure prediction methods combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a high-pressure (hp) phase of the intermetallic compound UCo crystalizing in the NaTl structure type ([Formula: see text]). We predict this compound to be formed at pressures below 9 GPa. Hp-UCo shows the same structural trends as the two experimentally known pseudo-binary compounds UCo0.2Rh0.8 and UNi0.8Pt0.2. We classify them as ordered solid solutions of a bcc lattice following Vegard's law. We predict hp-UCo and its adjacent phases UFe and UNi to be itinerant magnets. In the limit of vanishing spin-orbit interactions UFe and hp-UCo are half-metallic ferrimagnets. Spin-orbit coupling generally reduces the spin-polarization at the Fermi level. In case of hp-UCo the decrease depends on the applied DFT functional making the prediction of actual occurrence of half-metallicity problematic. In case of UFe the results are less dependent on the DFT functional. We demonstrate with these calulations that against 'common sense' also materials with heavy elements can be interesting candidates for half-metallicity. We highlight that the NaTl structure type should be an interesting candidate for further investigations of half-metallicity.,3
Hyperfine interaction in cobalt by high-resolution neutron spectroscopy.,We have investigated the ferromagnetic phase transition of elemental Co by high-resolution neutron backscattering spectroscopy. We monitored the splitting of the nuclear levels by the hyperfine field at the Co nucleus. The energy of this hyperfine splitting is identified as the order parameter of the ferromagnetic phase transition. By measuring the temperature dependence of the energy we determined the critical exponent [Formula: see text] and the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of [Formula: see text] K. The present result of the critical exponent agrees better with the predicted value (0.367) of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model than that determined previously by nuclear magnetic resonance.,3
Proximity two bands Eliashberg theory of electrostatic field-effect doping in a superconducting film of MgB2.,"A key aspect of field effect experiments is the possibility to induce charges on the first layers of a sample as a function of an applied gate voltage. It is therefore possible to study correlated phases of matter as a function of the induced charge density and the applied electric field. Moreover, resulting charge modulation along the direction of the applied electric field gives rise to junctions between perturbed and uneffected regions of the sample. In the framework of proximity effect Eliashberg theory, we investigate the consequence of an applied static electric field on the transition temperature of a two-band s-wave superconductor magnesium diboride. In most cases the only free parameter in the theory is the penetration depth of the applied electric field, whereas there is no freedom when the static perturbation is sufficiently weak. We come to the conclusion that the optimal way to enhance the critical temperature is to have a very thin film of magnesium diboride, otherwise the external electric field would not have substantial effect on superconductivity in this material.",3
Theoretical study of photonic bands of one-dimensional photonic crystals containing epsilon-near-zero metamaterials.,The photonic bands of a one-dimensional photonic crystal containing epsilon-near-zero metamaterials are investigated both theoretically and numerically. A theoretical expression of the edge frequencies of the photonic bands derived from the dispersion relation of the photonic crystal is in excellent agreement with the edge frequencies of the photonic bands calculated using the plane wave expansion method. These results are also confirmed using the transmittance obtained from the transfer matrix method. The theoretical expression of the band edge frequencies indicates that the magnitude of the bandgap increases as the frequency increases in the lower bands and becomes saturated in the higher bands. This is because the bands become flat in the higher frequency range.,3
"First-principles many-body study of the electronic and optical properties of CsK2Sb, a semiconducting material for ultra-bright electron sources.","We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of CsK2Sb, a semiconducting material for ultra-bright electron sources for particle accelerators. Our study, based on density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, provides all the ingredients to model the emission of this material as a photocathode, including band gap, band dispersion, and optical absorption. An accurate description of these properties beyond the mean-field picture is relevant to take into account many-body effects. We discuss our results in the context of state-of-the-art electron sources for particle accelerators to set the stage towards improved modeling of quantum efficiency, intrinsic emittance, and other relevant quantities determining the macroscopic characteristics of photocathodes for ultra-bright beams.",3
Slave rotor approach to exciton condensation in a two-band system.,"We have studied exciton formation and condensation in an extended Falicov-Kimball model, going beyond the weak coupling approach, employing a semi-analytical technique: the slave-rotor mean-field theory (SRMF). In this essentially strong coupling theory, charge and spin (or orbital/pseudospin) degrees are treated as independent degrees of freedom, coupled by a local constraint. Using a two-site-extension of SRMF, we capture the effective many body scale beyond conventional mean-field theory. While the formation of excitons is favoured by the interband hybridization [Formula: see text], it is strongly influenced by the on-site Coulomb interaction [Formula: see text]. Beyond a critical hybridization, there is condensation of excitons, leading to a transition from a metal to an excitonic insulator phase. Moreover, the behaviour of excitonic averages differs from the usual Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. Low-[Formula: see text] results show that excitonic order parameter (Delta) is continuous across the transition both for single as well as two-site approximation, changing to weakly first order one at intermediate [Formula: see text] for the later. The large-[Formula: see text] limit shows a continuous transition for two-site analysis but remains first order in the single-site approximation. The slave rotor theory gives a mixed state of excitons and metal in both the analyses. We have also checked the effect of intersite correlation and localized band hopping on the exciton condensation.",3
Correlation of optical properties and interface morphology in type-II semiconductor heterostructures.,"(Ga,In)As/GaAs/Ga(As,Sb) and (Ga,In)As/GaAs/Ga(N,As) type-II double quantum well heterostructures have been grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. A growth interruption procedure was used to intentionally modify the morphology of the internal interfaces. The heterostructures were investigated using continuous wave and time-resolved photoluminescence as well as optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy. We find a correlation between the interface morphology and optical and kinetic properties. A growth interruption of about 120 s yielded substantially smoother interfaces both on vertical as well as lateral length scales. On the other hand a considerably enhanced type-II recombination time as well as a longer electron tunneling time are observed. We attribute this to a reduced interface localization in case of smoother interfaces.",3
Electron paramagnetic resonance enhanced crystal field analysis for low point-group symmetry systems: C2v sites in Sm(3+):CaF2/SrF2.,"We present a comprehensive spectroscopic study of C[Formula: see text] point-group symmetry sites in Sm[Formula: see text]:CaF[Formula: see text]/SrF[Formula: see text] codoped with either NaF or LiF. Data includes electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of Zeeman and hyperfine interactions for the ground state, as well as site-selective excitation and fluorescence spectroscopy up to the [Formula: see text]G[Formula: see text] multiplet. Inclusion of the EPR data allowed us to determine unique crystal-field parameters. The parameters provide information about the geometry of the sites and the nature of the interactions between the Sm[Formula: see text] dopant and the alkaline earth co-dopant.",3
Magneto-elastic coupling behavior of the double perovskite Ba2FeMoO6.,"Ba2FeMoO6 has been reported to exhibit a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic transition with a Curie temperature above room temperature, and thus it is a potential material for spintronics. These exciting properties are related, at least in part, to combined structural and magnetic instabilities. A conventional analysis of lattice parameter data from the present study and literature in terms of spontaneous strain shows that the magnetic ordering is accompanied by a significant volume strain, which implies a strong coupling behavior of magneto-elastic properties in Ba2FeMoO6. In addition, to address the correlation between anti-site defects (ASD) and magnetic properties, we have carried out a comparative study of six cubic Ba2FeMoO6 polycrystals with different degrees of ASD. The correlations among the Curie temperature, low-temperature saturation magnetism, and ASD are discussed in detail using a combination of diffraction and magnetic measurements. This systematic study, especially the strain analysis, of Ba2FeMoO6 will facilitate its potential applications in the field of spin electronics and thin film engineering.",3
Sub nanometer clusters in catalysis.,"Sub nanometer transition metal clusters composed of a small number of atoms exhibit unexpected electronic, optical, magnetic and catalytic properties that often change substantially as a function of cluster atomicity. Several factors influence their unique catalytic behavior, including their discrete electronic structure of molecular-like orbitals and the accessibility of their low-coordinated atoms. In addition, these factors are strongly correlated so that changes in their morphology may provoke large modifications to their electronic structure and vice versa. The thermodynamic instability of clusters makes it necessary to stabilize them with protective ligands in solution or to support them on solid matrices for practical applications, which introduces non-negligible modifications into their properties. Understanding their cause and extent is the key point to potentially achieve a fine tuning of their catalytic behavior. Selected examples are discussed illustrating important points on this matter, such as the influence of cluster morphology on reactivity, the need of anchoring clusters to avoid sintering and deactivation, and the possible formation of clusters in solution or under reaction conditions, with the associated difficulty to identify them as the true active species.",3
A.C. susceptibility as a probe of low-frequency magnetic dynamics.,"The experimental technique of a.c. susceptibility can be used as a probe of magnetic dynamics in a wide variety of systems. Its use is restricted to the low-frequency regime and thus is sensitive to relatively slow processes. Rather than measuring the dynamics of single spins, a.c. susceptibility can be used to probe the dynamics of collective objects, such as domain walls in ferromagnets or vortex matter in superconductors. In some frustrated systems, such as spin glasses, the complex interactions lead to substantial spectral weight of fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, and thus a.c. susceptibility can play a unique role. We review the theory underlying the technique and magnetic dynamics more generally and give applications of a.c. susceptibility to a wide variety of experimental situations.",3
Spin dependence of crossed Andreev reflection and electron tunneling induced by Majorana fermions.,"We investigate spin dependence of the nonlocal transport induced by Majorana fermions in a one-dimensional ferromagnet-ferromagnetic-insulator-superconductor-ferromagnetic-insulator-ferrom agnet junction on the edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator. The results show that coupled Majorana fermions lead to the nonlocal transport processes including electron tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection, which can be tuned by adjusting the spin polarizations of the Majorana fermions. By manipulating the bands in the two ferromagnets, the nonlocal transport can be selected as either pure electron tunneling or pure crossed Andreev reflection, the transmission probability of which could be 100%. Furthermore, the pure electron tunneling and the pure crossed Andreev reflection are well controlled by the spin directions of the electron states in the two ferromagnets.",3
How pump-probe differential reflectivity at negative delay yields the perturbed-free-induction-decay: theory of the experiment and its verification.,"We present a simple but mathematically complete first-principles theory for the pump-probe differential reflectivity experiment at negative delay (probe preceding the pump) to show how it gives information about the perturbed-free-induction-decay of coherent polarization. The calculation, involving the optical Bloch equations to describe the induced polarization and the Ewald-Oseen idea to calculate the reflected signal as a consequence of the free oscillations of perturbed dipoles, also explicitly includes the process of lock-in detection of a double-chopped signal after it has passed through a monochromator. The theory giving a closed form expression for the measured signal in both time and spectal domains is compared with experiments on high quality GaAs quantum well sample. The dephasing time inferred experimentally at 4 K compares remarkably well with the inverse of the absorption linewidth of the continuous-wave photoluminescence excitation spectrum. Spectrally-resolved signal at negative delay calculated from our theoretical expression nicely reproduces the coherent spectral oscillations observed in our experiments, although exact fitting of the experimental spectra with the theoretical expression is difficult on account of multiple resonances.",3
Penetration depth study of the type-I superconductor PdTe2.,"Superconductivity in the topological non-trivial Dirac semimetal PdTe2 was recently shown to be type-I. We hereby report measurements of the relative magnetic penetration depth, [Formula: see text], on several single crystals using a high precision tunnel diode oscillator technique. The temperature variation [Formula: see text] follows an exponential function for [Formula: see text], consistent with a fully-gapped superconducting state and weak or moderately coupling superconductivity. By fitting the data we extract a [Formula: see text]-value of approximately 500 nm. The normalized superfluid density is in good agreement with the computed curve for a type-I superconductor with nonlocal electrodynamics. Small steps are observed in [Formula: see text], which possibly relates to a locally lower [Formula: see text] due to defects in the single crystalline sample.",3
High-accuracy large-scale DFT calculations using localized orbitals in complex electronic systems: the case of graphene-metal interfaces.,"Over many years, computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used extensively to study many different materials at the atomic scale. However, its application is restricted by system size, leaving a number of interesting systems without a high-accuracy quantum description. In this work, we calculate the electronic and structural properties of a graphene-metal system significantly larger than in previous plane-wave calculations with the same accuracy. For this task we use a localised basis set with the Conquest code, both in their primitive, pseudo-atomic orbital form, and using a recent multi-site approach. This multi-site scheme allows us to maintain accuracy while saving computational time and memory requirements, even in our exemplar complex system of graphene grown on Rh(1 1 1) with and without intercalated atomic oxygen. This system offers a rich scenario that will serve as a benchmark, demonstrating that highly accurate simulations in cells with over 3000 atoms are feasible with modest computational resources.",3
Peculiar covalent bonding of C60/6H-SiC(0 0 0 1)-(3 x 3) probed by photoelectron spectroscopy.,"High resolution photoemission with synchrotron radiation was used to study the interface formation of a thin layer of C60 on 6H-SiC(0 0 0 1)-(3 x 3), characterized by protruding Si-tetramers. The results show that C60 is chemisorbed by orbital hybridization between the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the p z orbital of Si adatom at the apex of the tetramers. The covalent nature of the bonding was inferred from core level as well as valence band spectra. The Si 2p spectra reveal that a large fraction (at least 45%) of the Si adatoms remain unbound despite the reactive character of the associated dangling bonds. This is consistent with a model in which each C60 is attached to the substrate through a single covalent C60-Si bond. A binding energy shift of the core levels associated with sub-surface Si or C atoms indicates a decrease of the SiC band bending caused by a charge transfer from the C60 molecules to the substrate via the formation of donor-like interface states.",3
ARPES studies on new types of electron-doped cuprate superconductors.,"For more than thirty years since the discovery of superconductivity in cuprates, it has been widely agreed that the superconductivity is realized by doping a charge-transfer insulator with charge carriers through chemical substitution. For electron-doped cuprates, however, the recent development of reduction annealing methods has enabled superconductivity for a very small amount of or even without chemical substitution. In this article, we review recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies on the new types of electron-doped cuprates with particular emphasis on the effect of reduction annealing. The presented results provide us with renewed insight into the phase diagram and the nature of the pseudogap not only on the electron-doped side but also in the entire doping range including hole doping.",3
Theory for the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in the quantum limit of Kramers Weyl semimetals.,"Negative magnetoresistance is rare in non-magnetic materials. Recently, negative magnetoresistance has been observed in the quantum limit of beta-Ag2Se, where only one band of Landau levels is occupied in a strong magnetic field parallel to the applied current. beta-Ag2Se is a material that hosts a Kramers Weyl cone with band degeneracy near the Fermi energy. Kramers Weyl cones exist at time-reversal invariant momenta in all symmorphic chiral crystals, and at a subset of these momenta, including the Gamma point, in non-symmorphic chiral crystals. Here, we present a theory for the negative magnetoresistance in the quantum limit of Kramers Weyl semimetals. We show that, although there is a band touching similar to those in Weyl semimetals, negative magnetoresistance can exist without a chiral anomaly. We find that it requires screened Coulomb scattering potentials between electrons and impurities, which is naturally the case in beta-Ag2Se.",3
The interaction of ethylene with free gold cluster cations: infrared photodissociation spectroscopy combined with electronic and vibrational structure calculations.,"The interaction of ethylene with free gold clusters of different sizes and charge states has been previously shown theoretically to involve two different adsorption modes of the C2H4 molecule, namely: the di-sigma- and pi-bonded ethylene adsorption configurations. Here, we present the first experimental investigation of the structure of a series of gas-phase gold-ethylene complexes, [Formula: see text]. By employing infrared multiple-photon dissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with first-principles calculations it is revealed that up to three C2H4 molecules preferably bind to gold cations in a pi-bonded configuration. The binding of all ethylene molecules is found to be dominated by partial electron donation from the ethylene molecules to the gold clusters leading to an activation of the C-C bond. The cooperative action of multiple coadsorbed C2H4 on [Formula: see text] is shown to enable additional charge back-donation and an enhanced C-C bond activation. In contrast, the strong C-H bond is not weakened and the experimental spectra do not give any indication for C-H bond dissociation. The possible correlations of the C-C bond stretch vibration with the C-C bond length and the net charge transfer are discussed.",3
Phase transition and electrical properties of aggregations of ethoxylated phytosterol surfactants by dielectric spectroscopy.,"The aggregation behaviors of the bio-friendly nonionic phytosterol ethoxylated (BPS-n) surfactants, in water were investigated by dielectric spectroscopy over a frequency range from 40 Hz to 110 MHz. Only the BPS-5 solution system observes dielectric relaxation and we judge this is because due to the difference in the chain length of BPS-n surfactants. Then we further analyze the BPS-5 solution system. Interestingly, we found that BPS-5 lamellar aggregations exist two phases before and after 6%-8% BPS-5 concentration by using the dielectric parameters and the phase parameters obtained by fitting dielectric spectrum and the theoretical model respectively. In addition, we concluded that the change of the electrical parameters such as surface conductivity and zeta potential are related to the lamellar phase structure. Besides, lamellar phases formed at a lower concentration are more stable than those at higher concentration by the thermodynamic analysis.",3
Controlling disorder in two-dimensional networks.,"Two-dimensional networks are constructed by reference to a distribution of ring sizes and a parameter (alpha) which controls the preferred nearest-neighbour spatial correlations, and allows network topologies to be varied in a systematic manner. Our method efficiently utilizes the dual lattice and allows the range of physically-realisable configurations to be established and compared to networks observed for a wide range of real and model systems. Three different ring distributions are considered; a system containing five-, six- and seven-membered rings only (a proxy for amorphous graphene), the configuration proposed by Zachariasen in 1932, and a configuration observed experimentally for thin (near-2D) films of SiO2. The system energies are investigated as a function of the network topologies and the range of physically-realisable structures established and compared to known experimental results. The limits on the parameter alpha are discussed and compared to previous results. The evolution of the network structure as a function of topology is discussed in terms of the ring-ring pair distribution functions.",3
On the work function of the surface Mo(0 0 1) and its temperature dependence: an ab initio molecular dynamics study.,"Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in NVT ensemble have been performed to investigate the finite temperature structure of the Mo(0 0 1) surface and its effect on work function (varphi). In accord with previous experimental and theoretical work, our simulations predict that a termination with a stable reconstruction pattern is formed at T = 123 K. This pattern vanishes when temperature is increased to 423 K or 623 K and a disordered surface phase is formed whose time average corresponds to a bulk-like termination. Our results demonstrate that the surface relaxation is an important factor contributing to thermal variation of varphi. At the lowest temperature, at which a stable reconstruction pattern is formed, the work function is found to increase by approximately 0.23 eV compared to relaxed unreconstructed surface. The disappearance of stable reconstruction pattern at elevated temperatures leads to a decrease of varphi by approximately 0.07 eV. In contrast, the values computed for a non-reconstructing surface Mo(1 1 0) at T = 123 K, 423 K and 623 K are found to be nearly identical to the zero temperature value, which is a consequence of restricted atomic motion due to high packing density in this surface.",3
Magnetotransport studies of optimally doped Sr(Fe1-x Co x )2As2.,"We report magnetotransport measurements and their scaling analysis for the optimally electron-doped Sr(Fe0.88Co[Formula: see text]As2 system. We observe that both the Kohler's and modified Kohler's scalings are violated. Interestingly, the Hall angle displays a quadratic temperature dependence (cot[Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] T (2)) similar to many cuprates and heavy fermion systems. The fact that this T (2) dependence is seen in spite of the violation of modified Kohler's scaling suggests that the Hall angle and magnetoresistance are not governed by the same scattering mechanism. We also observe a linear magnetoresistance in this system, which does not harbor a spin density wave ground state. Implications of our observations are discussed in the context of existing models for the magnetotransport of these strongly correlated electron systems.",3
NMR diagnosis of pseudo-scalar superconductivity in 3D Dirac materials.,Recently observed 4pi periodic Andreev bound states in 3D Dirac materials are attributed to conventional superconducting pairing. Our alternative explanation in terms of a novel form of parity breaking pseudo-scalar superconducting order can be sharply diagnosed by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation rate. The left-right symmetry breaking of the pseudo-scalar superconductivity can be directly probed as an anti-peak structure below T C in sharp contrast to the conventional Hebel-Slichter peak.,3
Effect of dynamically changing the substrate's easy axis on the response time of nematic samples.,"Recent discoveries of advanced photocontrolled materials have kindled a great deal of interest on their use as command surfaces that switch easy axis under light radiation. One noticeable point when using switchable surfaces on any application is how the dynamical process propagates to the bulk directors. In this paper, we theoretically study the effect of a relaxing easy axis over time on a nematic sample when finite anchoring energy and surface viscosity are included. We first consider the case where just one of the substrates decay over time in an initially distorted director organization. Next, we assume that both substrates can be switched simultaneously. From the calculated director we obtained the optical profile and finally the molecular response time of the material. The response time depends on both the materials and the surfaces properties including its decay time. Our results might be used for understanding and engineering liquid crystal displays and other electro-optical devices with photocontrolled alignment layers.",3
Nodal-line semimetal superlattices.,"Spatial modulations, such as superlattices, to realize topological materials have recently been studied in theoretical and experimental works. In this paper, we investigate properties of the superlattices of the nodal-line semimetal and the normal insulator. We consider two types of superlattices, with the stacking direction being perpendicular or parallel to the plane where the nodal line lies. In particular, we show that when the stacking direction is parallel to the plane, the nodal lines remain but they change their shapes because of the folding of the Brillouin zone. We also study the superlattices with magnetization. One can expect that the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase emerges in some cases, depending on the direction of the magnetization. If the magnetization is along the C 2-invariant axis, the superlattice becomes the Weyl semimetal phase if the C 2-invariant axis intersects the nodal lines, and otherwise it becomes the QAH phase.",3
Radiative recombination in narrow gap HgTe/CdHgTe quantum well heterostructures for laser applications.,Radiative recombination is studied in CdHgTe/HgTe QWs with bandgap in the 40-140 meV range using four-band Kane model. Calculated radiative lifetimes agree well with the photoconductivity kinetics measurements. We show that the side maxima in the valence band hinder the radiative recombination at high carrier concentrations and discuss how to overcome this effect for the development of long-wavelength lasers.,3
Mirror twin grain boundaries in molybdenum dichalcogenides.,"Mirror twin grain boundaries (MTBs) exist at the interface between two grains of 60 degrees rotated hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). These grain boundaries form a regular atomic structure that extends in one dimension and thus may be described as a one-dimensional (1D) lattice embedded in the 2D TMDC. In this review, the different atomic structures and compositions of these MTBs are discussed. The obvious formation of MTBs is by coalescence of two twinned grains. In addition, however, in MoSe2 and MoTe2 a different formation mechanism has been revealed for the formation of Mo-rich MTBs. It has been shown that excess Mo can be incorporated into the TMDC lattices. These excess Mo atoms can then reorganize into closed, triangular MTB-loops that can grow in size by adding more Mo atoms to them. This mechanism allows the formation of dense MTB networks in MoSe2 and MoTe2. Such MTB networks have been observed in samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and consequently their presence needs to be considered in understanding the properties of MBE grown MoSe2 and MoTe2. Density functional theory as well as photoemission spectroscopy of MTB networks have shown that MTBs exhibit dispersing 1D-bands that intersect the Fermi-level, thus suggesting that these are 1D electron systems. Consequently, experimental data have been interpreted to reveal a charge density wave (or Peierls) instability, as well as a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior for electrons confined in 1D. We discuss these observations and the controversies that remain in the interpretation of some data. The metallic properties of the MTBs and their formation in dense networks also sparked the potential use of such crystal modifications for making metallic contacts to MoTe2 or MoSe2. Moreover, these crystal modifications may also boost the catalytic properties of these materials.",3
"Structural determination of neutral Co n clusters (n = 4-10,13) through IR-UV two-color vibrational spectroscopy and DFT calculations.","We recorded IR spectra for neutral cobalt clusters via two-color IR-UV ionization, using the Free Electron Laser for intracavity experiments (FELICE). Well-resolved IR spectra are presented for [Formula: see text] (n = 4-10, 13) and analyzed with the help of Density Functional Theory calculations using two different correlation exchange functionals: the revisited Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (revTPSS) and the frequently used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approaches. Although we have not performed an extensive structure search, we tentatively assign the spectra for all cluster sizes except for n = 7, and n = 10. We find that neither of the two functionals chosen clearly outperforms the other in predicting IR spectra, and that relatively low scaling factors of 0.82 (PBE) and 0.8 (revTPSS) are required. In contrast to the magnetic moments, the calculated electric dipole moments fluctuate strongly as a function of cluster size and could therefore be used as an indirect probe to the cluster structure.",3
Coexistence of pressure-induced structural phases in bulk black phosphorus: a combined x-ray diffraction and Raman study up to 18 GPa.,"We report a study of the structural phase transitions induced by pressure in bulk black phosphorus by using both synchrotron x-ray diffraction for pressures up to 12.2 GPa and Raman spectroscopy up to 18.2 GPa. Very recently black phosphorus attracted large attention because of the unique properties of few-layers samples (phosphorene), but some basic questions are still open in the case of the bulk system. As concerning the presence of a Raman spectrum above 10 GPa, which should not be observed in an elemental simple cubic system, we propose a new explanation by attributing a key role to the non-hydrostatic conditions occurring in Raman experiments. Finally, a combined analysis of Raman and XRD data allowed us to obtain quantitative information on presence and extent of coexistences between different structural phases from ~5 up to ~15 GPa. This information can have an important role in theoretical studies on pressure-induced structural and electronic phase transitions in black phosphorus.",3
The stability of binary Al12X nanoclusters (X = Sc and Ti): superatom or Wade's polyhedron.,"Binary nanoclusters (NCs) exhibit strong potential as building blocks for tailor-made scientific materials based on the precise tuning of their electron countings and spin states along with the synergistic effects that originate from the constituent elements. Herein, we studied the electronic and geometric structures of transition metal (TM) doped aluminum (Al) Al12X NCs (X = Sc and Ti), which are binary systems that extend from representative superatom [Formula: see text] anions. On the basis of the photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Al12X anion and neutral structures are characterized as vertex-replaced icosahedron. The highly stable exohedral Al12X icosahedron is described based on an electron counting rule derived from the coupling of Wade-Mingos' rule and the jellium model.",3
The driving mechanism of the d-wave orbital order in the iron-based superconductors.,"We study the driving mechanism and the form of the orbital order in the electronic nematic phase of the iron-based superconductors (IBSs) within the random phase approximation of a 5-band model. We find the magnetic correlation energy of the system can be significantly improved when an orbital order of the d-wave form is spontaneously generated. On the other hand, the magnetic correlation energy increases as one introduce either an on-site or an extended s-wave orbital order. More specifically, we find that the on-site orbital order is disfavored by the Hund's rule coupling and the extended s-wave orbital order is disfavored by the stripy magnetic correlation pattern in the IBSs. Our work indicates that the orbital order and the spin nematic order in the IBSs develop in a cooperative fashion in the electronic nematic phase of the IBSs and should be both understood as a component of a composite order.",3
Two-photon photoemission spectroscopy of unoccupied electronic states at CuPc/PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) interfaces.,"The unoccupied electronic structure of stacked layers of copper(II)phthalocyanine (CuPc) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) on Ag(1 1 1) has been investigated by means of two-photon photoemission (2PPE). We find a rich electronic structure comprising at least five unoccupied electronic states which we identify based on their energetic position and their dispersion in momentum space. More specifically, we observe the first and the second image-potential states of the modified Ag(1 1 1) surface, as well as the metal-organic interface state (IS) inherent to the PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) interface. Moreover, two additional molecular features are observed for the CuPc/PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) system which we attribute to an unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO + 2) of CuPc. The 2PPE intensity of the IS exhibits a pronounced dependence on the pump photon energy, which closely follows the optical absorption of the outer molecular layer. This strongly points to charge transfer from the optically excited molecules to the interface state.",3
Dynamics on next-neighbour distances in liquid and undercooled gallium.,"Density fluctuations of liquid and 20 K undercooled gallium have been studied by neutron spectroscopy. The decay of density fluctuations has been recorded at the structure factor maximum over a wide temperature range up to twice the melting temperature. The amplitude of the scattering function falls off with rising temperature in a nonlinear way with a changing slope around [Formula: see text]. The derived generalized longitudinal viscosity shows an upturn with decreasing temperature in the same temperature range. This increase in viscosity can be understood that liquid gallium transforms from a more fluid liquid metal to a more viscous liquid metal in that temperature range upon cooling. The change in the amplitude shows a remarkable agreement with results from liquid aluminium, lead and rubidium. This study suggests a universal crossover in dynamics of liquid monatomic metals, despite the many peculiar properties of gallium.",3
Low energy excitations in NiO based on a direct Delta-SCF approach.,"This paper reports calculated energies and electronic structures of nineteen excited states in NiO based on a Delta-SCF approach reported previously for the [Formula: see text] transitions in NiO and Sr2CuO2Cl2. They are the spin-flip: [Formula: see text]; eight [Formula: see text]: (one electron) (3)A2g --> (3) T 2g , (two electron) (3)A2g --> (3) T 1g , (3)A2g --> a (1) E g , (3)A2g --> (1) T 2g , (3)A2g --> (1) T 1g , (3)A2g --> b(1) E g , (3)A2g --> b(1) T 2g ; two O(2p) --> Ni(3d); seven Ni(3d) --> O(2p) (including two spin-flip) and the O(2s) --> Ni(3d) charge transfer excitations, which span an energy range from 0.25 eV to 17.53 eV, and include the fundamental band gap associated with an excitonic O(2p) --> Ni(3d) transition at 4.23 eV. These are compared to absorption and emission spectra, and previous calculations. In the case of the O(2p) --> Ni(3d) excitations, comparisons are given for gap and Gamma-point energies derived from HF, PBE0, HSE06, B3LYP, B1WC, GGA and LDA one-electron approximations. Finally, the directly calculated Stokes shifts and associated luminescence energies for the two O(2p) --> Ni(3d) transitions are reported, where the excitonic value is found to be in good agreement with the recently reported experimental value.",3
Crystal structure and physical properties of the two stannides EuPdSn2 and YbPdSn2.,"We report on synthesis, crystal structure and physical properties of the isotypic compounds YbPdSn2 and EuPdSn2 crystallizing in the MgCuAl2-type structure. In both stannides a divalent state of respective rare earth element was found from analysis of the magnetic susceptibilities. Whereas in YbPdSn2 only weak paramagnetic behaviour is observed, in EuPdSn2 a long-range magnetic phase transition occurs at 12.5 K with complex magnetic behaviour evidenced by magnetic susceptibity and specific heat measurements. Under the influence of magnetic field, the magnetic behaviour was found to evolve from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic state as a consequence of a re-arrangement of magnetic moments.",3
Heat transfer in rough nanofilms and nanowires using full band ab initio Monte Carlo simulation.,"The Boltzmann transport equation is one of the most relevant frameworks to study the heat transport at the nanoscale, beyond the diffusive regime and up to the micrometer-scale. In the general case of 3D devices, the particle Monte Carlo approach of phonon transport is particularly powerful and convenient, and requires reasonable computational resources. In this work, we propose an original and versatile particle Monte Carlo approach parametrized by using ab initio data. Both the phonon dispersion and the phonon-phonon scattering rates have been computed by DFT calculation in the entire 3D Brillouin zone. To treat the phonon transport at rough interfaces, a combination of specular and diffuse reflections has been implemented in phase space. Thermal transport has been investigated in nanowires and thin films made of cubic and hexagonal Silicon, including edge roughness, in terms of effective thermal conductivity, phonon band contributions and heat flux orientation. It is shown that the effective thermal conductivity in quasi-ballistic regime obtained from our Monte Carlo simulation cannot be accurately fitted by simple semi-analytical Matthiessen-like models and that spectral approaches are mandatory to get good results. Our full band approach shows that some phonon branches exhibiting a negative group velocity in some parts of the Brillouin zone may contribute negatively to the total thermal flux. Besides, the thermal flux clearly appears to be oriented along directions of high density of states. The resulting anisotropy of the heat flux is discussed together with the influence of rough interfaces.",3
Giant magnetoresistance control and nontrivial metallic state manipulation in a transition-metal dichalcogenide spin-valve using a gate voltage.,"Here, we have theoretically studied the valley- and spin-resolved transport in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides based spin valve device, where both the Rashba spin orbit interaction and a gate voltage coexist in the central lead. In contrast to conventional semiconductor, nontrivial metallic states, such as, normal Rashba metal state (NRMS), anomalous Rashba metal state (ARMS), and Rashba ring metal state (RRMS), can be generated and manipulated by Rashba spin orbit interaction without the magnetic effect. For a nonferromagnetic double junction, it was found that the valley- and spin-resolved tunneling conductance can be effectively tuned by the incident energy, the junction length, the Rashba spin orbit interaction strength, and the gate voltage. Due to the spin texture and the Fermi wavevectors in the central lead, both the tunneling coefficient and the tunneling conductance all exhibit the remarkable characteristic features which enable us to diagnose the special states. For a ferromagnetic spin valve device, the resulting nontrivial metallic groundstates in the central lead also demonstrate directly in the giant magnetoresistance with notable unique features. We have further revealed that a perfect valley and spin giant magnetoresistance stems from the spin splitting and the spin-valley coupling. These valley- and spin-resolved phenomena are interesting for both fundamental research and applications.",3
Ultrafast formation and dynamics of interlayer exciton in a large-area CVD-grown WS2/WSe2 heterostructure.,"A WS2/WSe2 heterostructure is constructed by stacking a WS2 monolayer on the top of WSe2 monolayer fabricated with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Ultrafast transient spectroscopy is used to demonstrate the ultrafast charge transfer and interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterostructure. When the WS2/WSe2 heterostructure was photoexcitated at 617 nm (2.01 eV) to excite the A-exciton transition of WS2, an ultrafast photobleaching was observed around the WSe2 A-exciton transition at 749 nm. The bleaching signal lasts several nanoseconds, which is much longer than the A-exciton lifetime in both the WS2 and WSe2 monolayer film. Moreover, by selectively photoexciting the A-exciton of WSe2 at 749 nm in the heterostructure, an ultrafast photobleaching occurs around the WS2 A-exciton transition, the recovery of the bleaching shows a single exponential relaxation with typical time constant of ~1.8 ps. The very fast relaxation in the heterostructure probing around 620 nm is indicative that rich defect states exist below the conduction band in WS2, which can efficiently trap these electrons transferred from the WSe2 upon photoexcitation. Our spectroscopic results reveal that our CVD-grown WS2/WSe2 bilayer film has a type II heterostructure in nature at room temperature. With photoexcitation, electrons and holes can be separately confined in the WS2 and WSe2 layer, respectively; as a result, interlayer excitons are formed.",3
Simulation study on the translocation of polyelectrolyte through conical nanopores.,"Experiments have suggested that the conical nanopore may be a reasonable sensor for the biopolymer analysis as it can provide high-resolution current signal. In this paper, we use Langevin dynamics simulation to study the translocation of charged polymer (polyelectrolyte) through three different conical nanopores, a single-conical nanopore with large entry and small exit (pore I), a single-conical nanopore with small entry and large exit (pore II), and a double-conical nanopore with the tip (narrowest place) at the middle (pore III). Simulation shows that the detailed translocation behaviors are of pore structure dependence. Pore I might be the most reasonable one for the polyelectrolyte analysis, especially at strong monomer-pore attraction, since it can efficiently reduce the polyelectrolyte speed at the tip. The simulation results are interpreted by the free energy profiles of the polyelectrolyte translocation through different pores and the time of individual monomer passing through the tips.",3
Concentration dependent morphology and composition of n-alcohol modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide micelles.,"Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is one of the most commonly used surfactants in nanoparticle synthesis and stabilization. Usually, CTAB is used in high concentrations besides co-surfactants leading to well defined products but the complex mesoscopic CTAB structures stay mostly unknown. N-alcohols for instance are widely used co-surfactants which modify the properties of native CTAB dispersions. In this paper we report about a detailed structure analysis of n-alcohol modified CTAB micelles. In particular, n-pentanol and n-hexanol exhibit a significantly different influence on the size, shape and composition of CTAB micelles. Using a combination of small-angle x-ray spectroscopy (SAXS) and neutron scattering spectroscopy (SANS), we applied a method for a complete structural characterization of such micelles. The incorporation of n-pentanol into CTAB micelles generally does not influence the morphology but enhances the number of micelles due to the volume of the added alcohol. N-hexanol, however, leads to an elongation of the micelles as a function of its concentration. It was found by extended contrast variation measurements that this difference is caused by a different distribution of the alcohols between the micellar core and shell. N-pentanol molecules are generally located at the core-shell interface of the CTAB micelles with not only the head group but also two additional methylene bridging groups located in the micellar shell. This leads to an increase of its effective head group volume. In comparison, in n-hexanol modified micelles the whole alkyl chain is located within the micellar core. The detailed structure for n-alcohol modified CTAB micelles is described herein for the first time. The knowledge of the structural details found is indispensable for an in-depth understanding of CTAB-n-alcohol-water interfaces in general which is relevant for the synthesis of many functional nanostructures like mesoporous silica and gold or silver nanoparticles.",3
Magnetic anisotropy manipulation of the femtosecond laser-excited spin wave modes in full-Heusler Co2Fe1-x Mn x Al films.,"Spin-wave dynamics in full-Heusler Co2Fe1-x Mn x Al films have been investigated using all-optical pump-probe magneto-optical polar Kerr spectroscopy. We find magnetic damping and anisotropy can be modulated by composition x. Damon-Eshbach (DE) spin wave occurs only in the samples which present intrinsic magnetic damping and have huge uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, implying that intrinsic magnetic damping and huge uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is the necessary conditions to excite coherent DE spin wave. Kittel spin wave appears in low uniaxial magnetic anisotropic samples and presents extrinsic magnetic damping. Therefore, laser-excited spin-wave modes can be manipulated by magnetic anisotropy, whose physical picture is discussed phenomenologically.",3
Quantum theory of spin waves for helical ground states in a hollandite lattice.,"We perform spin-wave analysis of classical ground states of a model Hamiltonian proposed earlier (Mandal et al 2014 Phys. Rev. B 90 104420) for [Formula: see text] compounds. It is known that the phase diagram of the hollandite lattice (lattice of [Formula: see text] compounds) consists of four different helical phases (FH, A2H, C2H, CH phase) in the space of model parameters [Formula: see text]. The spin wave dispersion shows presence of gapless mode which interpolates between quadratic to linear depending on phases and values of J i . In most cases, the second lowest mode shows the existence of a roton-like minima mainly from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] path and it appears at the value of [Formula: see text] for constant [Formula: see text]. Few higher modes also show similar minima. Each helical phase has its characteristic traits which can be used to determine the phases itself. The analytical expressions of eigenmodes at high symmetry points are obtained which can be utilized to extract the values of J i . Density of states, specific heat and susceptibilities at low temperature have been studied within spin-wave approximation. The specific heat shows departure from T (1.5(3)) dependence found in three-dimensional unfrustrated ferromagnetic(anti-ferromagnetic) system which seems to be the signature of incommensurate helical phase. The parallel susceptibility is maximum for FH phase and minimum for CH phase at low temperature. The perpendicular susceptibility is found to be independent of temperature at very low temperature. Our study can be used to compare experiments on magnon spectrum, elastic neutron scattering, and finite temperature properties mentioned above for clean [Formula: see text] system as well as determining the values of J i .",3
The electronic transport efficiency of a graphene charge carrier guider and an Aharanov-Bohm interferometer.,"The electrostatic gating defined channel in graphene forms a charge carrier guider. We theoretically investigated electronic transport properties of a single channel and an Aharanov-Bohm (AB) interferometer, based on a charge carrier guider in a graphene nanoribbon. Quantized conductance is found in a single channel, and the guider shows high efficiency in the optical fiber regime, in good agreement with the experiment results. For an AB interferometer without a magnetic field, quantized conductance occurs when there are a few modes inside the channel. The local density of states (LDOS) inside the AB interferometer shows quantum scars when the scattering is strong. At low magnetic field, a periodical conductance oscillation appears. The conductance has a maximum value at zero magnetic field in the absence of intravalley scattering. The mechanism was investigated by LDOS calculations and a toy model.",3
"Electron single flexural phonon relaxation, energy loss and thermopower in single and bilayer graphene in the Bloch-Gruneisen regime.","The flexural phonons serve as one of the important modes of interaction in graphene that can inhibit carrier mobility. For the estimation of scattering due to flexural phonons a two-phonon scattering process had been in place, as due to symmetry constraints out-of-plane deformations modulate electron hopping only in the second order. But recently it has been shown that electrostatic gating can break the planar mirror symmetry and activate single flexural phonon scattering processes (Gunst et al 2017 Phys. Rev. Lett. 118 046601). Motivated by this we perform single flexural phonon mechanism based analytical and numerical calculations of the electron phonon relaxation rate, energy loss rate and thermopower in single and bilayer graphene and obtain the power exponents of these quantities in the Bloch Gruneisen regime using the non-equilibrium Boltzmann transport equation. We find that the scattering by flexural phonons substantially changes the temperature dependencies from that observed due to in-plane phonons but the carrier concentration dependencies remain the same as of the in-plane phonons for all the three investigated quantities.",3
Free-carrier dynamics in Au2Pb probed by optical conductivity measurements.,"We measured the optical reflectivity of the Dirac material Au2Pb in a broad frequency range (30-48 000 cm(-1)) for temperatures between 9 and 300 K. The optical conductivity, computed from the reflectivity, is dominated by free-carrier contributions from topologically trivial bulk bands at all temperatures. The temperature-independent total plasma frequency of these carriers is [Formula: see text] eV. Overall, optical response of Au2Pb is typically metallic with no signs of localization and bad-metal behavior.",3
Modeling the depletion effect caused by an addition of polymer to monoclonal antibody solutions.,"We present a theoretical study of colloidal stability of the model mixtures of monoclonal antibody molecules and non-adsorbing (no polymer-protein attraction) polymers. The antibodies are pictured as an assembly of seven hard spheres assuming a Y-like shape. Polymers present in the mixture are modeled as chain-like molecules having from 32 up to 128 monomers represented as hard spheres. We use Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory to construct the two molecular species and to calculate measurable properties. The calculations are performed in the osmotic ensemble. In view that no direct attractive interaction is present in the model Hamiltonian, we only account for the entropic contribution to the phase equilibrium. We calculate chemical potentials and the equation of state for the model mixture to determine the liquid-liquid part of the phase diagram. We investigate how the critical antibody number density depends on the degree of polymerization and the bead size ratio of the polymer and protein components. The model mixture qualitatively correctly predicts some basic features of real systems. The effects of the model 'protein' geometry, that is the difference in results for the flexible Y-shaped protein versus the rigid spherical one, are also examined.",3
"Numerical analysis of surface and edge states in slabs, stripes, rods and surface steps of topological insulators.","By numerically solving the effective continuous model of a topological insulator with parameters corresponding to the band structure of the topological insulator Bi2Se3, we analyze possible appearance of one-dimensional states in various geometries. Massless Dirac fermions are found at the edges of thin ribbons with surface oriented not only along the van der Waals gap but also in the perpendicular direction. Thick rods and slabs with surface steps host massive modes localized on surface faces. We argue that the the origin of the massive modes is due to the difference in the Dirac point energy of adjacent faces. The absence of one-dimensional states near edges of a large rectangular rod and surface steps is demonstrated.",3
Sign reversal of magnetoresistance and inverse spin Hall effect in doped conducting polymers.,"Conducting polymers, where pristine polymers are doped by active dopants, have been used in a variety of flexible optoelectronic device applications due to their tunable conductivity values. Charge transport in these materials has been intensively studied for over three decades. However, spin transport properties in these compounds have remained elusive. Here, we studied two polaron-dominated and trap-dominated spin transport processes in two types of PEDOT:PSS polymers that are lightly and heavily doped, respectively. Using pulsed spin-pumping and spin-injection techniques, we found the sign of inverse spin Hall effect and magnetoresistance obtained from the lightly doped PEDOT:PSS film can reverse its polarity as a function of temperature and applied bias, in contrast to that in the heavily doped PEDOT:PSS film. Our work provides an alternative approach for studying the spin transport in conducting polymer films.",3
Quantum contributions to the magnetoconductivity of critically disordered superconducting TiN films.,"The onset of superconductivity in the presence of disorder is a fundamental problem of condensed matter physics. Here we investigate the magnetoconductance of disordered ([Formula: see text]) superconducting TiN films above the critical temperature T c. We show that the magnetoconductivity of moderately disordered films with [Formula: see text] is in full agreement with the perturbative theory of quantum contributions to conductivity. We demonstrate that the magnetoconductivity of films with [Formula: see text] is also in agreement with the perturbative theory down to temperatures [Formula: see text]. The quantitative discrepancy between experiment and theory develops only below temperatures [Formula: see text] for films with [Formula: see text]. This discrepancy can be eliminated if we assume steeper temperature dependence of the Larkin's electron-electron attraction strength, [Formula: see text]. The obtained temperature dependence of electron phase breaking time [Formula: see text] is in agreement with theoretical predictions for all samples.",3
Giant anomalous Hall effect in a ferromagnetic Kagome-lattice semimetal.,"Magnetic Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry are expected to generate strong intrinsic anomalous Hall effects, due to their large Berry curvature. Here, we report a magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate, Co3Sn2S2, with a quasi-two-dimensional crystal structure consisting of stacked Kagome lattices. This lattice provides an excellent platform for hosting exotic topological quantum states. We observe a negative magnetoresistance that is consistent with the chiral anomaly expected from the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi level. The anomalous Hall conductivity is robust against both increased temperature and charge conductivity, which corroborates the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism in momentum space. Owing to the low carrier density in this material and the significantly enhanced Berry curvature from its band structure, the anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall angle simultaneously reach 1130 Omega(-1) cm(-1) and 20%, respectively, an order of magnitude larger than typical magnetic systems. Combining the Kagome-lattice structure and the out-of-plane ferromagnetic order of Co3Sn2S2, we expect that this material is an excellent candidate for observation of the quantum anomalous Hall state in the two-dimensional limit.",3
Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics with DeltaSCF excited states.,"Accurate modelling of nonadiabatic transitions and electron-phonon interactions in extended systems is essential for understanding the charge and energy transfer in photovoltaic and photocatalytic materials. The extensive computational costs of the advanced excited state methods have stimulated the development of many approximations to study the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD) in solid-state and molecular materials. In this work, we present a novel triangle upSCF-NA-MD methodology that aims to account for electron-hole interactions and electron-phonon back-reaction critical in modelling photoinduced nuclear dynamics. The excited states dynamics is described using the delta self-consistent field (triangle upSCF) technique within the density functional formalism and the trajectory surface hopping. The technique is implemented in the open-source Libra-X package freely available on the Internet (https://github.com/Quantum-Dynamics-Hub/Libra-X). This work illustrates the general utility of the developed triangle upSCF-NA-MD methodology by characterizing the excited state energies and lifetimes, reorganization energies, photoisomerization quantum yields, and by providing the mechanistic details of reactive processes in a number of organic molecules.",3
Optimizing special quasirandom structure (SQS) models for accurate functional property prediction in disordered 2D alloys.,"2D materials such as MXenes have garnered attention in a wide field of applications ranging from energy to environment to medical. Properties of 2D materials can be tailored via alloying and in some cases, solid-solutions (disordered alloys) are formed. To predict the disordered alloy properties via first-principles, the model structure needs to imitate the random arrangements of alloyants and yet remains computationally tractable. Using density functional theory and the cluster expansion method, we investigate the accuracy of using of special quasirandom structures (SQSs) for predicting disordered 2D alloy properties, evaluating the effect of SQS supercell size on the prediction quality of formation energies, elastic properties, and structural parameters. We illustrate the findings with 5 different disordered binary [Formula: see text] MXene alloy systems (where M = Ti and M' = Zr, Hf, V, Nb, or Ta), demonstrating that SQSs around 6-8 times the primitive cell (N = 6-8) are sufficient to attain convergence in the property predictions versus supercell size. For formation energies, SQSs with N > 4 are found to reproduce the formation energies of the fully disordered phase within ~2.5 meV. For the simulation of the experimentally-synthesized TiNbCO2, we find convergence in structural parameters and elastic tensors at N ~ 6. We traced the convergence of the predictions to the convergence in the band structure-related properties via analysis of the electronic densities-of-states and the projected crystal overlap Hamilton population. Our findings suggest that modest sized SQSs would reproduce the properties of disordered MXene alloys. The results should help guide the investigations of structure-property relationships in other disordered 2D materials as well.",3
Exact equations for averaged electromagnetic field and its fluctuations at wave multiple scattering by plane periodic array of magnetic microelements.,"Electromagnetic wave (EM) multiple scattering by a plane periodic array of magnetic microelements in free space is considered analytically by natural subdividing of the EM wave into the averaged and fluctuation components. Each magnetic element is characterized by magnetic susceptibility tensor and shape. An exact Dyson integral equation is derived for the magnetic field Floquet-Bloch amplitude in-plane averaged over an array unit cell. The mass operator of the Dyson equation is expressed via the T-scattering operator of the array unit cell that satisfies a type of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We showed that magnetic field fluctuations are generated by the Bragg-Laue diffraction of an averaged magnetic field on the periodic array and are described inside the array as waves propagating with the Laue wave vectors equal to the difference between the in-plane wave vector of the incident magnetic field and the reciprocal lattice wave vector. We derived, for the first time, an exact quadrature to calculate magnetic field fluctuations from their averaged value. These general results are illustrated by a simple Born approximation. In particular, we revealed a mechanism of discrete waveguide excitation by an incident plane EM wave via the averaged EM wave Brag-Laue diffraction on the magnetic microelement array in the quasi-static approach when the wavelength of incident EM is much larger than the sizes of magnetic elements and periods of the array. The mode energy excitation coefficient at normal incidence of the plane EM wave on the array is evaluated.",3
Second-harmonic generation as a probe for structural and electronic properties of buried GaP/Si(0 0 1) interfaces.,Optical second-harmonic generation is demonstrated to be a sensitive probe of the buried interface between the lattice-matched semiconductors gallium phosphide and silicon with (0 0 1) orientation. Ex situ rotational anisotropy measurements on GaP/Si heterostructures show a strong isotropic component of the second-harmonic response not present for pure Si(0 0 1) or GaP(0 0 1). The strength of the overlaying anisotropic response directly correlates with the quality of the interface as determined by atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy. Systematic comparison of samples fabricated under different growth conditions in metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy reveals that the anisotropy for different polarization combinations can be used as a selective fingerprint for the occurrence of anti-phase domains and twins. This all-optical technique can be applied as an in situ and non-invasive monitor even during growth.,3
Edge-insensitive magnetism and half metallicity in graphene nanoribbons.,"Realizing magnetism in graphene nanostructures is a decade-long challenge. The magnetic edge state and half metallicity in zigzag graphene nanoribbons are particularly promising (Son et al 2006 Nature 444 347). However, its experimental realization has been hindered by the stringent requirement of the mono-hydrogenated zigzag edge. Using first-principle calculations, we predict that free-carrier doping can overcome this challenge and realize ferromagnetism and half-metallicity in narrow graphene nanoribbons of general types of edge structures. This magnetism exists within the density range of gate-doping experiments (~10(13) cm(-2)) and has large spin polarization energy up to 17 meV per carrier, which induces a Zeeman splitting equivalent to an external magnetic field of a few hundred Tesla. Moreover, we trace the formation of this edge-insensitive magnetism to the quantum confinement of the electronic state near the band edge and reveal the scaling law of magnetism versus the ribbon width. Our findings suggest that combining doping with quantum confinement could be a general tool to realize transition-metal-free magnetism in light-element nanostructures.",3
Structures and magnetic properties of small [Formula: see text] and Co n-1Cr(+) (n = 3-5) clusters.,"Small cobalt clusters [Formula: see text] and their single chromium atom doped counterparts Co n-1Cr(+) (n = 3-5) were studied mass spectrometrically by measuring the infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectra of the corresponding argon tagged complexes. The geometric and electronic structures of the [Formula: see text] and Co n-1Cr(+) (n = 3-5) clusters as well as their Ar complexes were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The obtained lowest energy structures were confirmed by comparing the IRMPD spectra of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (n = 3-5, m = 3 and 4) with the corresponding calculated IR spectra. The calculations reveal that the doped Co n-1Cr(+) clusters retain the geometric structures of the most stable [Formula: see text] clusters. However, the coupling of the local magnetic moments within the clusters is altered in a size-dependent way: the Cr atom is ferromagnetically coupled in Co2Cr(+) and Co3Cr(+), while it is antiferromagnetically coupled in Co4Cr(+).",3
First-principles calculations and Raman scattering evidence for local symmetry lowering in rhombohedral ilmenite: temperature- and pressure-dependent studies.,"ATiO3-type materials may exist in two different crystalline forms: the perovskite and ilmenite. While many papers have devoted their attention to evaluating the structural properties of the perovskite phase, the structural stability of the ilmenite one still remains unsolved. Here, we present our results based on the lattice dynamics and first-principles calculations (density functional theory) of the CdTiO3 ilmenite phase, which are confronted with experimental data obtained through micro Raman spectroscopy that is a very good tool to probe the local crystal structure. Additional Raman bands, which are not foreseen from group-theory for the ilmenite rhombohedral structure, appeared in both low temperature (under vacuum condition) and high-pressure (at room temperature) spectra. The behavior can be explained by considering the local loss of inversion symmetry operation which reduces the overall space group from [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) to [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). Our results can also be extended to other ilmenite-type compositions.",3
Crystallographic orientation errors in mechanical exfoliation.,"We evaluate the effect of mechanical exfoliation of van der Waals materials on crystallographic orientations of the resulting flakes. Flakes originating from a single crystal of graphite, whose orientation is confirmed using STM, are studied using facet orientations and electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD). While facets exhibit a wide distribution of angles after a single round of exfoliation ([Formula: see text]), EBSD shows that the true crystallographic orientations are more narrowly distributed ([Formula: see text]), and facets have an approximately [Formula: see text] error from the true orientation. Furthermore, we find that the majority of graphite fractures are along armchair lines, and that the cleavage process results in an increase of the zigzag lines portion. Our results place values on the rotation caused by a single round of the exfoliation process, and suggest that when a 1-2 degree precision is necessary, the orientation of a flake can be gauged by the orientation of the macroscopic single crystal from which it was exfoliated.",3
Raman spectra and structural peculiarities of TeO2-TeO3 mixed oxides.,"Raman spectra of the mixed crystalline oxides of the (1 - x)TeO2 + xTeO3 (x = 0, (1/4), (1/2), 1) series were recorded and simulated by using the DFT calculations. Good agreement between observed and calculated Raman spectra makes it possible to establish unambiguous assignment for all prominent Raman lines. This result gives an insight into relations between structural peculiarities and observed spectral features for the crystals promising as nonlinear optical materials. Highlights * Several mixed TeO2-TeO3 crystals were synthesized by solid-state chemistry * DFT calculations well describe structures and phonon spectra of TeO2-TeO3 oxides * Raman lines can be assigned to internal vibrations of TeO4 and TeO6 polyhedrons * Observed Raman bands can be used as fingerprints of different structural units.",3
Sub-gap optical response in the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate alpha-RuCl3.,"We report detailed optical experiments on the layered compound alpha-RuCl3 focusing on the THz and sub-gap optical response across the structural phase transition from the monoclinic high-temperature to the rhombohedral low-temperature structure, where the stacking sequence of the molecular layers is changed. This type of phase transition is characteristic for a variety of tri-halides crystallizing in a layered honeycomb-type structure and so far is unique, as the low-temperature phase exhibits the higher symmetry. One motivation is to unravel the microscopic nature of THz and spin-orbital excitations via a study of temperature and symmetry-induced changes. The optical studies are complemented by thermal expansion experiments. We document a number of highly unusual findings: A characteristic two-step hysteresis of the structural phase transition, accompanied by a dramatic change of the reflectivity. A complex dielectric loss spectrum in the THz regime, which could indicate remnants of Kitaev physics. Orbital excitations, which cannot be explained based on recent models, and an electronic excitation, which appears in a narrow temperature range just across the structural phase transition. Despite significant symmetry changes across the monoclinic to rhombohedral phase transition and a change of the stacking sequence, phonon eigenfrequencies and the majority of spin-orbital excitations are not strongly influenced. Obviously, the symmetry of a single molecular layer determines the eigenfrequencies of most of these excitations. Only one mode at THz frequencies, which becomes suppressed in the high-temperature monoclinic phase and one phonon mode experience changes in symmetry and stacking. Finally, from this combined terahertz, far- and mid-infrared study we try to shed some light on the so far unsolved low energy (<1 eV) electronic structure of the ruthenium 4d (5) electrons in alpha-RuCl3.",3
Charge self-consistent many-body corrections using optimized projected localized orbitals.,"In order for methods combining ab initio density-functional theory and many-body techniques to become routinely used, a flexible, fast, and easy-to-use implementation is crucial. We present an implementation of a general charge self-consistent scheme based on projected localized orbitals in the projector augmented wave framework in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package. We give a detailed description on how the projectors are optimally chosen and how the total energy is calculated. We benchmark our implementation in combination with dynamical mean-field theory: first we study the charge-transfer insulator NiO using a Hartree-Fock approach to solve the many-body Hamiltonian. We address the advantages of the optimized against non-optimized projectors and furthermore find that charge self-consistency decreases the dependence of the spectral function-especially the gap-on the double counting. Second, using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo we study a monolayer of SrVO3, where strong orbital polarization occurs due to the reduced dimensionality. Using total-energy calculation for structure determination, we find that electronic correlations have a non-negligible influence on the position of the apical oxygens, and therefore on the thickness of the single SrVO3 layer.",3
Strong metal-support interactions impart activity in the oxygen reduction reaction: Au monolayer on Mo2C (MXene).,"The rational design of low-cost, high-efficiency, corrosion-resistant and persistent-activity oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts is a common goal for the large-scale application of fuel cells. Inspired by the excellent characteristics of MXenes when used as substrate materials and recent experiments of depositing metal nanoparticles on MXenes, we systematically investigated monolayer metal thin films decorated by Mo2C (MXene) (MML/Mo2C, M = Cu, Pd, Pt, Ag and Au) as ORR catalysts using density functional theory. According to the stability and adsorption properties, we speculate that AuML/Mo2C possesses outstanding ORR performance and enhanced durability in comparison with Pt/C catalysts. The ORR on AuML/Mo2C proceeds through a four-electron reduction pathway with comparable or even better activity than Pt(1 0 0), Pt(1 1 1) and commercial Pt/C catalysts both kinetically and thermodynamically. Strong metal-support interactions give rise to larger electronic perturbations in the supported Au monolayer in contact with Mo2C, which strengthen the adsorption of oxygen-containing species and enhance the catalytic activity. Our current results indicate that AuML/Mo2C is a promising ORR catalyst candidate to replace precious Pt/C catalysts due to its good stability, enhanced durability, low cost and high activity. We hope our results will inspire more experimental and theoretical research to further design, explore and apply advanced metal monolayer-supported MXene composites.",3
Origin of the Fermi arcs in cuprates: a dual role of quasiparticle and pair excitations.,"Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) mesurements in cuprates have given key information on the temperature and angle dependence of the gap (d-wave order parameter, Fermi arcs and pseudogap). We show that these features can be understood in terms of a Bose condensation of interacting pairons (preformed hole pairs which form in their local antiferromagnetic environment). Starting from the basic properties of the pairon wavefunction, we derive the corresponding k-space spectral function. The latter explains the variation of the ARPES spectra as a function of temperature and angle up to T (*), the onset temperature of pairon formation. While Bose excitations dominate at the antinode, the fermion excitations dominate around the nodal direction, giving rise to the Fermi arcs at finite temperature. This dual role is the key feature distinguishing cuprate from conventional superconductivity.",3
Superconducting-state properties and electronic band structure calculations of a noncentrosymmetric Th7Ni3 compound.,"Superconducting-state properties of a noncentrosymmetric Th7Ni3 compound have been investigated using magnetic, electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements as well as by electronic band structure calculations. The study reveals that the studied compound is a dirty type-II superconductor with [Formula: see text] K and a weak electron-phonon coupling [Formula: see text]. Moreover, in contrast to an exotic superconductivity observed previously in Th7Fe3 and Th7Co3, data reported in this paper give clear evidence that Th7Ni3 is a conventional single-gap superconductor. The experimental results are supported by DFT calculations of the electronic band structure, density of states, electron localization functions and Fermi surfaces which were performed using the full-potential linear muffin-tin-orbital and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave methods. Theoretical data show that asymmetric spin-orbit coupling in Th7Ni3 is quite small; hence the electronic band structure of this compound is weakly affected by the spin-orbit effects. We have determined fundamental parameters of Th7Ni3 and compared the superconducting properties with other Th7T3 (T = Fe, Co and Ru) compounds.",3
Thermal transport studies on charge density wave materials LaPt2Si2 and PrPt2Si2.,"We measured the thermal properties of polycrystalline samples of LaPt2Si2 and PrPt2Si2 using thermopower (S) along with thermal conductivity (kappa) in the temperature range 10 K-300 K. Significant anomalies related to charge density waves (CDW) around 112 K and 88 K respectively have been observed in [Formula: see text] in both systems. Analysis of thermopower by a two band model suggests that the observations are consistent with a reduction of electron charge density. A change in slope accompanied by a drop in the value of thermal conductivity has been observed around T CDW in case of LaPt2Si2. Analysis of thermal conductivity of this material suggests that the CDW mainly affects electronic contribution to thermal transport. Only a slight change of slope has been detected in temperature dependent thermal conductivity in the case of PrPt2Si2 around T CDW, while its resistivity shows a clear anomaly which shows that electronic part of thermal conductivity is mainly influenced by the CDW in this case also. It is interesting to note that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity remains unaffected by the CDWs in both materials.",3
"Unusual optical isotropy in anisotropic alkali metal perchlorates MClO 4 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs).","We report a detailed study on structural, vibrational, born effective charge (BEC), electronic and optical properties of the alkali metal perchlorates, MClO 4(M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) based on Density functional theory. The ground state calculations are done using plane wave pseudopotential method by including dispersion corrected method for more accurate prediction of structural and vibrational frequencies. The calculated lattice parameters and bond lengths are consistent with the experimental values. Further, detailed interpretation of the zone centered vibrational modes yields good concurrence between the experimental and calculated values. There is a decrease in wavelength with an increase in frequency (blue shift) from Li --> Na --> K --> Rb --> Cs. The obtained BEC shows the mixed covalent-ionic character of the compounds. The electronic and optical properties are calculated using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method by TB-mBJ potential. The TB-mBJ band structure shows indirect band gap with O-2p states dominating in the valence band. In spite of anisotropic structure, alkali metal perchlorates are found to possess optical isotropy.",3
Realistic estimates of superconducting properties for the cuprates: reciprocal-space diagrammatic expansion combined with variational approach.,"We propose a systematic approach to the systems of correlated electrons, the so-called [Formula: see text]-DE-GWF method, based on reciprocal-space ([Formula: see text]-resolved) diagrammatic expansion of the variational Gutzwiller-type wave function for parametrized models of correlated fermions. The present approach, in contrast to either variational Monte-Carlo (VMC), or the recently developed real-space diagrammatic expansion of the Gutzwiller-type wave function (direct-space DE-GWF technique), is applicable directly in the thermodynamic limit and thus is suitable for describing selected singular features of the wave-vector-dependent quantities. We employ the [Formula: see text]-DE-GWF method to extract the non-analytic part of the two leading moments of the fermion spectral-density function across the (two-dimensional) Brillouin zone for the Hubbard model and away from the half-filling. Those moments are used to evaluate the nodal quasiparticle velocities and their spectral weights in the correlated superconducting state. The two velocities determined in that manner exhibit scaling with the electron concentration qualitatively different from that obtained earlier for the excited states of the high-T c cuprates within the projected quasi-particle ansatz, and the results are in a very good quantitative agreement with experimental data if interpreted as those characterizing the spectrum below and above the observed kink. We provide a detailed discussion of the two gaps and two excitation branches (two velocities) appearing naturally within our DE-GWF approach. The two separate sets of characteristics distinguish the renormalized quasiparticle states very close to the Fermi surface from the deeper correlated-state properties. Also, an enhancement of the [Formula: see text]-dependent magnetic susceptibility is shown to contain a spin-fluctuation contribution within our language. Finally, the [Formula: see text]-DE-GWF approach is compared to both the VMC and real-space DE-GWF results for the cases of Hubbard and t-J-U models.",3
The effect of energy-dependent electron scattering on thermoelectric transport in novel topological semimetal CoSi.,"Cobalt monosilicide and its solid solutions with Fe or Ni crystallize in B20 cubic noncentrosymmetric structure. These compounds have long been known as promising thermoelectric materials. Recently it was revealed, that they also have unconventional electronic topology. This renewed interest to the investigation of their transport properties. In order to improve theoretical description of thermoelectric transport in these compounds, we take into account electron scattering beyond commonly used constant relaxation time approximation. Using first principle calculations, we investigate the scattering of charge carriers by phonons and point defects. The dependence of the scattering rate on the energy correlates with that for the total density of states. This implies that in this material not only the intraband, but also the interband scattering is important, especially for bands with low density of states. The Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity of CoSi and of dilute solid solutions Co1-x M x Si (M = Fe or Ni, x < 0.1) are calculated as a function of temperature and the alloy composition. We show that the account of strong energy dependence of relaxation time is important for the description of experimentally observed rapid increase of the resistivity and qualitative change of its temperature dependence with the substitution of cobalt for iron, as well as for the description of the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, its temperature and composition dependence.",3
Structural and magnetic properties of bulk Mn2PtSn.,"Interplay between structural and magnetic order parameters is one of the key mechanisms of tuning properties of materials intended for device applications in spintronics. Here, using density functional calculations, we study combined effects of tetragonal distortion and non-collinear magnetic order in Mn2PtSn. We show that this material has two energetically close energy minimums corresponding to tetragonal lattice. In one of these phases, Mn2PtSn exhibits ferrimagnetic order with nearly fully compensated total magnetic moment, while in the other phase that corresponds to the lowest energy, a non-collinear magnetic arrangement emerges, with very large canting angle of the Mn local magnetic moments. The non-collinear alignment is explained through the interplay of exchange couplings between nearest and next nearest neighbor Mn atoms. Results are compared with those reported in recent literature, both experimental and theoretical.",3
Multifunctional two-dimensional semiconductors SnP3: universal mechanism of layer-dependent electronic phase transition.,"Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors SnP3 are predicted, from first-principles calculations, to host moderate band gaps (0.72 eV for monolayer and 1.07 eV for bilayer), ultrahigh carrier mobility ( approximately 10(4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for bilayer), strong absorption coefficients ( approximately 10(5) cm(-1)) and good stability. Moreover, the band gap can be modulated from an indirect character into a direct one via strain engineering. For experimental accessibility, the calculated exfoliation energies of monolayer and bilayer SnP3 are smaller than those of the common arsenic-type honeycomb structures GeP3 and InP3. More importantly, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is discovered with the layer number N > 2. We demonstrate, in remarkable contrast to the previous understandings, that such phase transition is largely driven by the correlation between lone-pair electrons of interlayer Sn and P atoms. This mechanism is universal for analogues phase transitions in arsenic-type honeycomb structures (GeP3, InP3 and SnP3).",3
Inconsistency between linearized Thomas-Fermi approximation and electron-ionized impurity scattering rate in the first Born approximation.,"We show that by computing the electron-impurity scattering rate at the first order via Fermi's golden rule, and assuming that the localized impurity potential is of Yukawa form, one obtains a wave vector transfer distribution which is inconsistent with the finite temperature linearized Thomas-Fermi approximation for n-type semiconductors. Our previous findings show that this is not the case for the carrier nondegenerate dynamics, because the average wave vector transferred being in general negligible in this regime. Moreover, we examine the behavior of the electron-impurity differential cross-sections in the first Born approximation for relevant values of the wave vector transfer. We find that in the majority of collisions, the scattering probabilities differ at the most by 1% from the estimates computed by means of the impurity potential at random phase approximation level.",3
Phase transitions of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with a long-range hopping.,"The interacting Kane-Mele model with a long-range hopping is studied using analytical method. The original Kane-Mele model is defined on a honeycomb lattice. In the work, we introduce a four-lattice-constant range hopping and the on-site Hubbard interaction into the model and keep its lattice structure unchanged. From the single-particle energy spectrum, we obtain the critical strength of the long-range hopping t L at which the topological transition occurs in the non-interacting limit of the model and our results show that it is independent of the spin-orbit coupling. After introducing the Hubbard interaction, we investigate the Mott transition and the magnetic transition of the generalized strongly correlated Kane-Mele model using the slave-rotor mean field theory and Hartree-Fock mean field theory respectively. In the small long-range hopping region, it is a correlated quantum spin Hall state below the Mott transition, while a topological Mott insulator above the Mott transition. By comparing the energy band of spin degree of freedom with the one of electrons in non-interacting limit, we find a condition for the t L-driven topological transition. Under the condition, critical values of t L at which the topological transition occurs are obtained numerically from seven self-consistency equations in both regions below and above the Mott transition. Influences of the interaction and the spin-orbit coupling on the topological transition are discussed in this work. Finally, we show complete phase diagrams of the generalized interacting topological model at some strength of spin-orbital coupling.",3
Electronic structure of the Ge/Si(1 0 5) hetero-interface: an ARPES and DFT study.,"We present a joint experimental and theoretical study of the electronic properties of the rebonded-step reconstructed Ge/Si(1 0 5) surface which is the main strained face found on Ge/Si(0 0 1) quantum dots and is considered a prototypical model system for surface strain relaxation in heteroepitaxial growth. Using a vicinal surface as a model system for obtaining a stable single-domain film structure with large terraces and rebonded-step surface termination, we realized an extended and ordered Ge/Si planar hetero-junction suitable for direct study with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At the coverage of four Ge monolayers photoemission spectroscopy reveals the presence of 2D surface and film bands displaying energy-momentum dispersion compatible with the 5 x 4 periodicity of the system. The good agreement between experiment and first-principles electronic structure calculations confirms the validity of the rebonded-step structural model. The direct observation of surface features within 1 eV below the valence band maximum corroborates previously reported analysis of the electronic and optical behavior of the Ge/Si hetero-interface.",3
Inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory of the small polaron problem.,"We present an inhomogeneous dynamical mean field theory (I-DMFT) that is suitable to investigate electron-lattice interactions in non-translationally invariant and/or inhomogeneous systems. The presented approach, whose only assumption is that of a local, site-dependent self-energy, recovers both the exact solution of an electron for a generic random tight-binding Hamiltonian in the non-interacting limit and the DMFT solution for the small polaron problem in translationally invariant systems. To illustrate its full capabilities, we use I-DMFT to study the effects of defects embedded on a two-dimensional surface. The computed maps of the local density of states reveal Friedel oscillations, whose periodicity is determined by the polaron mass. This can be of direct relevance for the interpretation of scanning-tunneling microscopy experiments on systems with sizable electron-lattice interactions. Overall, the easy numerical implementation of the method, yet full self-consistency, allows one to study problems in real-space that were previously difficult to access.",3
CHEERS: a tool for correlated hole-electron evolution from real-time simulations.,"We put forward a practical nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) scheme to perform real-time evolutions of many-body interacting systems driven out of equilibrium by external fields. CHEERS is a computational tool to solve the NEGF equation of motion in the so called generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz and it can be used for model systems as well as first-principles Hamiltonians. Dynamical correlation (or memory) effects are added to the Hartree-Fock dynamics through a many-body self-energy. Applications to time-dependent quantum transport, time-resolved photoabsorption and other ultrafast phenomena are discussed.",3
Metal and ligand effects on the stability and electronic properties of crystalline two-dimensional metal-benzenehexathiolate coordination compounds.,"The cohesive energy, phonon spectrum and quantum molecular-dynamic simulation have been used successively to determine whether the crystalline two-dimensional (2D) metal-benzenehexathiolate (M-BHT) coordination compounds are stable or not. The electronic structures of stable M-BHTs and the corresponding inorganic semiconducting materials have been compared. From the point of view of satisfying stoichiometric ratios and saturation of chemical bonds, we designed possible planar molecular structures and demonstrated that there may be two different 2D M-BHTs, i.e. group II-[Formula: see text] and group IV-[Formula: see text]. However, the cohesive energy calculation indicates that the group IV-[Formula: see text] coordination compound cannot be obtained by thermodynamic equilibrium growth. In contrast, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] from the group II-[Formula: see text] have not only thermodynamic stability, but also dynamic stability due to their phonon spectrum with no imaginary frequency. Moreover, they are still the two most stable ones when the bridge atom S of ligand BHT is replaced by the other chalcogens of O, Se and Te. Further studies indicated that [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] both have room temperature dynamic stability and exhibit semiconducting. The exceptional stability and relatively narrow band gap make them advantageous over their inorganic counterparts. Our findings open opportunities to search for new 2D planar conducting coordination compound for organic electronic applications.",3
Higher-Order Topology in Bismuth.,"The mathematical field of topology has become a framework to describe the low-energy electronic structure of crystalline solids. A typical feature of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principle calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, we probe the unique signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport. Our work establishes bismuth as a higher-order topological insulator.",3
Structural properties of silicon-germanium and germanium-silicon core-shell nanowires.,"Core-shell nanowires made of Si and Ge can be grown experimentally with excellent control for different sizes of both core and shell. We have studied the structural properties of Si/Ge and Ge/Si core-shell nanowires aligned along the [Formula: see text] direction, with diameters up to 10.2 nm and varying core to shell ratios, using linear scaling density functional theory. We show that Vegard's law, which is often used to predict the axial lattice constant, can lead to an error of up to 1%, underlining the need for a detailed ab initio atomistic treatment of the nanowire structure. We analyse the character of the intrinsic strain distribution and show that, regardless of the composition or bond direction, the Si core or shell always expands. In contrast, the strain patterns in the Ge shell or core are highly sensitive to the location, composition and bond direction. The highest strains are found at heterojunction interfaces and the surfaces of the nanowires. This detailed understanding of the atomistic structure and strain paves the way for studies of the electronic properties of core-shell nanowires and investigations of doping and structure defects.",3
Giant negative electrocaloric effect induced by domain transition in the strained ferroelectric thin film.,"Electrocaloric effect (ECE) of ferroelectric materials is highly dependent on the domain transition with temperature. The effect of domain transition on the ECE of PbTiO3 (PTO) ferroelectric thin films subjected to different mismatch strains is investigated by a phase field model based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. The simulation results demonstrate that there exists a multiple-to-single domain transition induced by temperature in the PTO thin film. The domain transition occurs at a temperature that is much lower than Curie temperature, resulting in a giant negative ECE in the strained ferroelectric thin film. Furthermore, the domain transition temperature and the corresponding negative ECE can be tuned by the magnitude of mismatch strain. The present study suggests an effective way to obtain a giant negative ECE by domain transitions in the strained ferroelectric thin film.",3
Torsion-induced vortex switching and skyrmion-like state in ferroelectric nanodisks.,"The controllability of vortex state in ferroelectric nanodisks under the effect of external torsion is investigated in this work based on phase-field simulation. We discover a novel Bloch skyrmion-like state in ferroelectric nanodisks due to the combining effect of the torsion and the depolarization field. Moreover, a new strategy is proposed to achieve deterministic switching of the vortex chirality in the ferroelectric nanodisks. On the one hand, if a fixed external electric field is applied to the nanodisk, the vortex chirality can be switched by the torsion force. On the other hand, if we apply a fixed torsion force to the nanodisk, the vortex chirality can be readily switched by an external electric field. The feasibility of both mechanical and electrical switching of the vortex in the ferroelectric nanodisks is based on the trilinear coupling between the toroidization, polarization and shear strain of the system. The influences of temperature, electric field, torsion, and size of the nanodisk on the control of the vortex state are further revealed. Our findings shed light on the practical control and application of ferroelectric dipole vortices.",3
Protein refractive index increment is determined by conformation as well as composition.,"The refractive index gradient of the eye lens is controlled by the concentration and distribution of its component crystallin proteins, which are highly enriched in polarizable amino acids. The current understanding of the refractive index increment ([Formula: see text]) of proteins is described using an additive model wherein the refractivity and specific volume of each amino acid type contributes according to abundance in the primary sequence. Here we present experimental measurements of [Formula: see text] for crystallins from the human lens and those of aquatic animals under uniform solvent conditions. In all cases, the measured values are much higher than those predicted from primary sequence alone, suggesting that structural factors also contribute to protein refractive index.",3
Surface states of gapped electron systems and semi-metals.,"With a generic lattice model for electrons occupying a semi-infinite crystal with a hard surface, we study the eigenstates of the system with a bulk band gap (or the gap with nodal points). The exact solution to the wave functions of scattering states is obtained. From the scattering states, we derive the criterion for the existence of surface states. The wave functions and the energy of the surface states are then determined. We obtain a connection between the wave functions of the bulk states and the surface states. For electrons in a system with time-reversal symmetry, with this connection, we rigorously prove the correspondence between the change of Kramers degeneracy of the surface states and the bulk time-reversal Z 2 invariant. The theory is applicable to systems of (topological) insulators, superconductors, and semi-metals. Examples for solving the edge states of electrons with/without the spin-orbit interactions in graphene with a hard zigzag edge and that in a two-dimensional d-wave superconductor with a ([Formula: see text]) edge are given in appendices.",3
Unconventional field-effect transistor composed of electrons floating on liquid helium.,"We report on an unconventional macroscopic field effect transistor composed of electrons floating above the surface of superfluid helium. With this device unique transport regimes are realized in which the charge density of the electron layer can be controlled in a manner not possible in other material systems. In particular, we are able to manipulate the collective behavior of the electrons to produce a highly non-uniform, but precisely controlled, charge density to reveal a negative source-drain current. This behavior can be understood by considering the propagation of damped charge oscillations along a transmission line formed by the inhomogeneous sheet of two-dimensional electrons above, and between, the source and drain electrodes of the transistor.",3
Importance of spin current generation and detection by spin injection and the spin Hall effect for lateral spin valve performance.,"Lateral spin valves are attractive device geometries where functional spin currents can be generated and detected by various mechanisms, such as spin injection and the direct and the inverse spin Hall effect. To understand the mechanisms behind these effects better, as well as their potential for application in devices, we combine multiple mechanisms in multi-terminal Pt-Py-Cu lateral spin valves: we generate pure spin currents in the copper spin conduit both via the spin Hall effect in platinum and electric spin injection from permalloy and detect signals both via conventional non-local detection and via the inverse spin Hall effect in the same device at variable temperatures. Differences are observed, which we explain by the different spin injection and detection mechanisms, revealing their importance for the temperature dependence, which is not just governed by the spin transport in the conduit as previously claimed. By determining a different sensitivity of the observed effects on the interfaces, we highlight the importance of the exact current path for the device operation.",3
In situ and ex situ NMR for battery research.,"A rechargeable battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a variety of devices such as mobile phones, laptop computers, electric automobiles, etc. A battery generally consists of four components: a cathode, an anode, a separator and electrolytes. The properties of these components jointly determine the safety, the lifetime, and the electrochemical performance. They also include, but are not limited to, the power density and the charge as well as the recharge time/rate associated with a battery system. An extensive amount of research is dedicated to understanding the physical and chemical properties associated with each of the four components aimed at developing new generations of battery systems with greatly enhanced safety and electrochemical performance at a significantly reduced cost for large scale applications. Advanced characterization tools are a prerequisite to fundamentally understanding battery materials. Considering that some of the key electrochemical processes can only exist under in situ conditions, which can only be captured under working battery conditions when electric wires are attached and current and voltage are applied, make in situ detection critical. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a non-invasive and atomic specific tool, is capable of detecting all phases, including crystalline, amorphous, liquid and gaseous phases simultaneously and is ideal for in situ detection on a working battery system. Ex situ NMR on the other hand can provide more detailed molecular or structural information on stable species with better spectral resolution and sensitivity. The combination of in situ and ex situ NMR, thus, offers a powerful tool for investigating the detailed electrochemistry in batteries.",3
Nanowire based bioprobes for electrical monitoring of electrogenic cells.,"The continuous miniaturization of electronic components and the emergence of nano-biotechnology has opened new perspectives to monitor electrical activities at the single cell level. Here, we describe the creation of very high surface-to-volume ratio passive devices (vertical nanowire probes) using large-scale fabrication process, allowing to follow the electrical activity of mammalian neurons. Based on conventional silicon processing, the silicon nanowires were silicided in platinum in order to improve their electrochemical performances and to guarantee their biocompatibility. Very high signal to noise ratio was achieved (up to 2000) when measuring spontaneous action potentials. Moreover, this bio-platform was used to record the impact of various bio-chemical and electrical stimulations on neuronal activity. To conclude, this study proposes a thorough comparison of the characteristics and performances of these new nanowire-based nanoprobes with the main alternative systems published up to now.",3
Laser-induced ultrafast transport and demagnetization at the earliest time: first-principles and real-time investigation.,"It is generally believed that there are at least two ways to use an ultrafast laser pulse to demagnetize a magnetic sample. One is to directly photo-demagnetize the system through spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and the other is to utilize ultrafast hot electron transport without SOC. The challenge is that these two processes are entangled on the same time scale. While the experimental results have been inconclusive, theoretical investigations are even scarcer, beyond those earlier studies based on spin superdiffusion. For instance, we do not even know how fast electrons move under laser excitation and how far they move. Here we carry out a first-principles time-dependent calculation to investigate how fast electrons actually move under laser excitation and how large the electron transport affects demagnetization on the shortest time scale. To take into account the transport effect, we implement the intraband transition in our theory. In the bulk fcc Ni, we find the effect of the spin transport on the demagnetization is extremely small, no more than 1%. The collective electron velocity in Ni is 0.4 A fs(-1), much smaller than the Fermi velocity, and the collective displacement is no more than 0.1 A. But this does not mean that electrons do not travel fast; instead we find that electron velocities at two opposite crystal momenta cancel each other. We follow the Gamma-X line and find a huge dispersion in the velocities in the crystal momentum space. In the Fe/W(1 1 0) thin film, the overall demagnetization is larger than Ni, and the Fermi velocity is higher than Ni. However, the effect of the spin transport is still small in the Fe/W(1 1 0) thin film. Based on our numerical results and existing experimental findings, we propose a different mechanism that can explain two latest experimental results. Our finding sheds new light on the effect of ballistic transport on demagnetization.",3
Manipulation of the magnetoresistance effect in a double-helix DNA.,"Magnetoresistance (R m) of a double-stranded (G:C) N DNA sandwiched between ferromagnetic electrodes has been studied using the transfer matrix method of the tight-binding model. A R m magnitude up to 72.5% for DNA in its natural structure is observed when the spin-orbit coupling with the helix spring geometry and a possible dephasing effect are taken into account. It can be greatly manipulated by stress or torque applied to the DNA with respect to its axis. In addition, the external voltage bias can also be used to efficiently control R m. The dependence of R m on the DNA length in a decaying oscillation form is observed.",3
"Large orbital magnetic moments of small, free cobalt cluster ions Co[Formula: see text] with n [Formula: see text].","The size dependent electronic structure and separate spin and orbital magnetic moments of free Co[Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) cluster ions have been investigated by x-ray absorption and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion trap. A very large orbital magnetic moment of [Formula: see text] per atom was determined for Co[Formula: see text], which is one order of magnitude larger than in the bulk metal. Large orbital magnetic moments per atom of approximately 1 [Formula: see text] were also found for Co[Formula: see text], Co[Formula: see text], and Co[Formula: see text]. The orbital contribution to the total magnetic moment shows a non-monotonic cluster size dependence: The orbital contribution increases from a local minimum at n = 2 to a local maximum at n = 5 and then decreases with increasing cluster size. The 3d spin magnetic moment per atom is nearly constant and is solely defined by the number of 3d holes which shows that the 3d majority spin states are fully occupied, that is, 3d hole spin polarization is 100%.",3
Asymmetric alloy formation at the Fe-on-Ti and Ti-on-Fe interfaces.,"The Fe-on-Ti and Ti-on-Fe interfaces were studied experimentally by Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray reflectometry (XRR) on Ti/Fe/Ti trilayers grown on Si(1 1 1) substrates by vacuum evaporation. The nanoscale structure and composition were explored in cross sections using TEM, the layer structure and the interface widths by specular x-ray reflectometry. MS was applied to identify the interface alloy phases and to determine the pure and alloyed Fe layer fractions. The experimental results were compared with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of layer growth on Fe or Ti underlayers of different orientations. The concentration distributions provided by MD simulations show an asymmetry at the interfaces in the layer growth direction. The transition is atomically sharp at the Ti-on-Fe interface for the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) crystallographic orientations of the Fe underlayer, while it spreads over a few atomic layers for Fe(1 1 1) underlayer and for all studied Ti underlayer orientations at the Fe-on-Ti interface. MS and XRR data on Ti/Fe/Ti trilayers confirm the asymmetry between the bottom and top Fe interface, but the inferred interface widths considerable exceed those deduced from the MD simulations.",3
"The relationship between the coherent size, binding energy and dissociation dynamics of charge transfer excitons at organic interfaces.","At organic semiconductor interfaces, an electron and a hole can be bound Coulombically to form an interfacial charge transfer (CT) exciton. It is still under debate how a CT exciton can overcome its strong binding and dissociate into free carriers. Experimentally, capturing the evolution of the CT exciton on time (fs-ps) and length scales (nm) in which the dissociation process occurs is challenging. To overcome this challenge, time-resolved two photon photoemission spectroscopy is used to measure the binding energies and electronic coherent sizes of a series of CT states at organic interfaces, and capture the temporal dynamics of these CT excitons after their excitation. Using zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)/fullerene (C60) interface as a model system, it is shown that the interfacial CT process first populates a hot CT state with a coherent size of ~4 nm. Hot and delocalized CT excitons subsequently relax into CT excitons with lower energies and smaller coherent sizes. To correlate the CT exciton properties with the dissociation efficiency, we develop a method that exploits graphene field effect transistors to probe the rate and yield of free carrier generation at the interface. Our results show that exciton dissociation can be more efficient if one can extract electrons from the hot and delocalized CT state. We propose a cascade structure that would serve this purpose.",3
"Crystalline thin films of silica: modelling, structure and energetics.","The static structural and energetic properties of thin crystalline films ( approximately two dimensional bilayers) of silica, SiO2, are modelled. Two potential models are considered in which the key interactions are described by purely harmonic terms and more complex electrostatic terms, respectively. The relative energetic stability of two potential crystalline forms, which represent alternative ways of tiling two dimensional space, is discussed. Coherent and incoherent distortions are introduced to the simulated crystals and their effects considered in terms of the ring structure formed by the Si atoms. The spatial relationship between distorted rings is analysed. An experimentally-observed single crystalline configuration is considered for comparison throughout.",3
Wave nature of conduction electrons in amorphous Co90Sc10 and Fe90Sc10 alloys.,"The resistivity of amorphous Fe90Sc10 and Co90Sc10 alloys can be described well in terms of a simple model based on the wave character of electrons and their associated tunnelling over the temperature ranges ~1.9 K to 135 K and ~1.9 K to 12 K respectively. The extended range of agreement between experiment and theory for amorphous Fe90Sc10 is linked with its relatively small mean free path of [Formula: see text] = 0.32 nm, thus allowing electron waves to tunnel between clusters. On the other hand the restricted region of tunnelling of electron waves for amorphous Co90Sc10 alloys is linked with its relatively large mean free path of [Formula: see text] = 0.48 nm which restricts the ability for tunnelling between clusters while enabling electron waves to tunnel between different regions with a cluster.",3
Enhanced indirect-to-direct inter-valley scattering in germanium under tensile strain for improving the population of electrons in direct valley.,"A theoretical model is proposed to analyze the inter-valley electron transferring between direct Gamma and indirect L valleys, which sheds light on the electron conduction dynamics in (0 0 1) tensile strained Ge. Inter-valley scattering is included to calculate average scattering time between Gamma and L valleys based on a time-dependent Hamiltonian describing the electron-phonon interaction. Numerical results indicate that enhanced indirect-to-direct inter-valley scattering and reduced direct-to-indirect inter-valley scattering are reliable by introducing tensile strain in Ge material. The population ratio of electrons in Gamma and L valleys in strained Ge will increase one to two orders of magnitude compared to the model without the inter-valley scattering. The results offer fundamental understanding of phonon engineering for further improvement of performance in strained germanium light sources.",3
Atomistic modeling of the infrared response of fullerenes under hydrostatic pressure.,"The anharmonic infrared spectrum of individual C60 and C70 fullerenes under hydrostatic pressure was theoretically computed by means of atomistic simulations. Using a tight-binding model for the fullerenes and a simple particle-based pressure-transmitting fluid, the structural and vibrational properties were determined at room temperature and up to 20 GPa. All properties generally exhibit relative variations that are linear with increasing pressure, but whose magnitude can be comparable to pure thermal effects. The bond length contraction usually agrees with existing results, and for C70 our approach manages to reproduce the occasionally negative pressure coefficient found for some low-frequency modes in experiments.",3
Suppression of structural instability in LaOBiS2-x Se x by Se substitution.,"Isovalent substitution of S by Se in LaOBiS2-x Se x has a substantial effect on its electronic structure and thermoelectric properties. To investigate the possible role of BiS2 structural instability, we have studied the local structure of LaOBiS2-x Se x ([Formula: see text]) using temperature dependent Bi L3-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The results reveal that the local structure of the two compounds is significantly different. The BiS2 sub-lattice is largely distorted in LaOBiS2 (x = 0.0), with two in-plane Bi-S1 distances separated by approximately 0.4 A instead LaOBiSSe (x = 1.0) showing much smaller local disorder with two in-plane Bi-Se distances in the plane being separated by approximately 0.2 A. Temperature dependent study shows that the two Bi-S1 distances are characterized by different bond strength in LaOBiS2 (x = 0.0) while it is similar for the Bi-Se distances in LaOBiSSe (x = 1.0). The out of plane Bi-S2 bond is harder in LaOBiSSe indicating that the structural instability of BiS2 layer has large effect on the out-of-plane atomic correlations. The results suggest that the local structure of LaOBiS2-x Se x is an important factor to describe differing electronic and thermal transport of the two compounds.",3
Correlation of Kondo effect and molecular conformation of the acceptor molecule in the TTF-TCNE charge transfer complex.,"A Kondo resonance has been observed on purely organic molecules in several combinations of charge transfer complexes on a metal surface. It has been regarded as a fingerprint of the transfer of one electron from the donor to the extended pi orbital of the acceptor's LUMO. Here, we investigate the stoichiometric checkerboard structure of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) on a Au(1 1 1) surface using scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy at 4.8 K. We find a bistable state of the TCNE molecules with distinct structural and electronic properties. The two states represent different conformations of the TCNE within the structure. One of them exhibits a Kondo resonance, whereas the other one does not, despite of both TCNE types being singly charged.",3
Spin qubits: spin relaxation in coupled quantum dots.,The spin-flip scattering mechanism in coupled self-assembled quantum dots made with InAs/GaAs with the use of realistic material parameters is theoretically and numerically investigated. The electron wave functions within the coupled system have been calculated by the 8-band strain dependent [Formula: see text] theory. The phonon coupling to electrons is described by deformation potential and piezoelectric acoustic phonons. First order perturbation theory has been employed to evaluate the spin relaxation rates and spin-flip time T1. The numerical results show that parameters like the interdot distance and the applied static magnetic field are of crucial importance in spin-flip mechanism. The spin relaxation time has been also studied by varying the lattice temperature and by showing the differences between the quantum computing operation temperature ([Formula: see text] K) and large temperatures.,3
"Water desorption from rapidly-heated metal oxide surfaces-first principles, molecular dynamics, and the Temkin isotherm.","Quantitative understanding and control of water and impurity desorption from steel surfaces are crucial for high-voltage, pulsed power, vacuum technology, catalysis, and environmental applications. We apply a suite of modeling techniques, ranging from electronic density functional theory, to classical molecular dynamics (MD) and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of fast water desorption from different surfaces of hematite Fe2O3 and Cr2O3. Water binding energies on chromium oxide are found to be higher than iron oxide at zero temperature. MD simulations are conducted on Fe2O3 surfaces using thermodynamically consistent initial water inventory deduced with GCMC. The resulting time- and temperature-dependent desorption profiles on the Fe2O3 [Formula: see text] surfaces show multi-water cooperative behavior which cannot be deduced from zero temperature predictions, but which are in reasonable agreement with simple Temkin isotherm model estimates if finite temperature effects are incorporated into the Temkin binding energy parameter. Qualitatively different desorption behaviors associated with the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] facets are discussed.",3
Behavior of the breathing pyrochlore lattice Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 in applied magnetic field.,"The breathing pyrochlore lattice material Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 exists in the nearly decoupled limit, in contrast to most other well-studied breathing pyrochlore compounds. As a result, it constitutes a useful platform to benchmark theoretical calculations of exchange interactions in insulating Yb(3+) magnets. Here we study Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 at low temperatures in applied magnetic fields as a further probe of the physics of this model system. Experimentally, we consider the behavior of polycrystalline samples of Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 with a combination of inelastic neutron scattering and heat capacity measurements down to 75 mK and up to fields of 10 T. Consistent with previous work, inelastic neutron scattering finds a level crossing near 3 T, but no significant dispersion of the spin excitations is detected up to the highest applied fields. Refinement of the theoretical model previously determined at zero field can reproduce much of the inelastic neutron scattering spectra and specific heat data. A notable exception is a low temperature peak in the specific heat at approximately 0.1 K. This may indicate the scale of interactions between tetrahedra or may reflect undetected disorder in Ba3Yb2Zn5O11.",3
Architecture of nanoscale ferroelectric domains in GaMo4S8.,"Local-probe imaging of the ferroelectric domain structure and auxiliary bulk pyroelectric measurements were conducted at low temperatures with the aim to clarify the essential aspects of the orbitally driven phase transition in GaMo4S8, a lacunar spinel crystal that can be viewed as a spin-hole analogue of its GaV4S8 counterpart. We employed multiple scanning probe techniques combined with symmetry and mechanical compatibility analysis to uncover the hierarchical domain structures, developing on the 10-100 nm scale. The identified domain architecture involves a plethora of ferroelectric domain boundaries and junctions, including primary and secondary domain walls in both electrically neutral and charged configurations, and topological line defects transforming neutral secondary walls into two oppositely charged ones.",3
Enhanced superconductivity of Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2 under surface potassium dosing.,"Surface potassium dosing has been proven to be an effective method in tuning the electron doping and enhancing the superconducting transition temperatures in both iron chalcogenides and electron doped iron pnictides. However, it is not clear how surface potassium dosing affects the hole doping and superconductivity in hole doped Fe-based superconductors. Here we performed K-dosing on Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2, a prototypical hole-doped iron pnictide compound, and explored the electronic structure by in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Starting from the slightly over-doped Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2, surface K-dosing effectively reduces the hole concentration towards optimal doping and enhances the superconductivity. Intriguingly, the enhancement of superconductivity does not slow down at optimal doping, and the gap further increases with K dosing even when the carrier doping effect is saturated. Meanwhile, the quasiparticle coherence of the inner hole pockets is enhanced by higher K dosing. Our results uncover a novel scattering-reduction effect of K-dosing in Ba1-x K x Fe2As2, which collaborates with the carrier doping effect and enhances superconductivity.",3
Static and dynamic structures of liquid Ba8Ga16Sn30: a melt of the thermoelectric clathrate compounds.,"X-ray diffraction and inelastic x-ray scattering measurements of liquid Ba8Ga16Sn30 have been carried out to investigate local structure and atomic dynamics in the liquid. The pair distribution function shows shorter and longer interatomic distances in the first coordination shell. The dynamic structure factor exhibits the inelastic excitations on both sides of the quasielastic central peak. The inelastic excitations disperse with increasing the momentum transfer, suggesting the longitudinal acoustic mode. We found a low energy excitation in addition to the longitudinal acoustic excitation in the dynamic structure factor and it reminds us a strong relationship with a rattling motion of a guest (Ba) atom in the solid state. The temperature dependence of the pair distribution function and the longitudinal acoustic excitation energy is very weak in a range from 600 to 900 degrees C. The result suggests that Ba and other atoms in the melt are located around minimum positions of the effective pair potential approximated as a harmonic one.",3
Consequences of the inherent density dependence in one dimensional Dirac materials.,"Dirac materials are systems in which the dispersion is linear in the vicinity of the Dirac points. As a consequence of this linear dispersion, the Fermi velocity is independent of density and these systems exhibit unusual behavior and possess unique physical properties that are of considerable interest. In this work we study the ground state behavior of 1D Dirac materials in two ways. First, using the Virial theorem, we find agreement with a previous result in regards to the total average ground state energy. Namely, that the total average ground state energy, regardless of dimensionality, is found to be [Formula: see text] where r s is a dimensionless constant that's a measure of density and [Formula: see text] is a constant independent of r s . As a consequence, thermodynamic results as well as the characteristic exponents of 1D Fermi systems are density independent. Second, using conventional techniques, i.e. Tomanaga-Luttinger theory, we find several unique properties that are a direct consequence of the dispersion. Specifically, the collective modes of the system exhibit electron density independence predicted from the Virial theorem. Finally, possible experimental realization of our predictions of density independent exponents are briefly discussed.",3
1D tungsten oxide nanostructures on a Cu(1 1 0) surface.,"Thin epitaxial layers of tungsten oxide on metal substrates are suitable as model systems for investigation of chemical reactivity and catalytic properties. However, the ability to prepare epitaxial tungsten oxide model system in situ is quite rare. Here we present a method to prepare highly ordered tungsten oxide thin film on a Cu(1 1 0) single crystal substrate using physical vapor deposition in a reactive atmosphere of atomic oxygen. The oxygen induced reconstruction of the copper substrate gives rise to unique self-organized 1D structures of tungsten oxide parallel with the Cu[1 -1 0] crystallographic direction. Utilizing a combination of photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations we reveal emergent physicochemical properties related to the low-dimensionality of the system. Specifically, we observe a support mediated charge redistribution at the interface and a momentum dependent modulation of the valence-band electronic structure. The unusual character of the 1D oxide nanostructures on Cu(1 1 0) surface opens up a unique avenue for preparation of tungsten oxide-based functionalized nanostructures and provides options for further investigation of the fundamental properties of tungsten oxide.",3
Mechanical avalanches promoted by magnetoelastic coupling in magnetic metallic glasses.,"The effect of magnetoelastic coupling on the mechanical behavior of magnetic metallic glasses is studied by superposing a magnetic field to the mechanical load during deformation experiments. The mechanical response is studied from the point of view of the global behavior, characterized by the Young's modulus, and from the perspective of the avalanches, estimated from the intermittency of the deformation signal. The influence of several intensities and orientations of magnetic field is analyzed in two amorphous alloys with different magnetostriction. For the highly magnetostrictive alloy, the decrease of the macroscopic Young's modulus under certain magnetic fields is accompanied by the promotion of mechanical avalanches, a fact that suggests that in this case the magnetoelastic coupling involves some extent of non-linear addition of the magnetic and mechanical energies.",3
Universal scaling in first-order phase transitions mixed with nucleation and growth.,"Matter exhibits phases and their transitions. These transitions are classified as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While the latter has a well-established theory of the renormalization group, the former is only qualitatively accounted for by classical theories of nucleation, since their predictions often disagree with experiments by orders of magnitude. A theory to integrate FOPTs into the framework of the renormalization-group theory has been proposed but seems to contradict with extant wisdom and lacks numerical evidence. Here we show that universal hysteresis scaling as predicted by the renormalization-group theory emerges unambiguously when the theory is combined intimately with the theory of nucleation and growth in the FOPTs of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising model driven by a linearly varying externally applied field below its critical point. This not only provides a new method to rectify nucleation theories, but also unifies the theories for both classes of transitions and FOPTs can be studied using universality and scaling similar to their continuous counterpart when nucleation and growth are properly taken into account.",3
Anisotropic conductivity in 2D massive Dirac Fermions: an effect of time reversal symmetry breaking in the surface states of a topological insulator.,"We calculate the conductivity tensor for massive Dirac Fermions within the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We consider the effect of two different types of scattering mechanism, namely scalar and magnetic, that act incoherently and use the symmetries of the transition rate to exactly solve the Boltzmann equation. We prove that the conductivity can be anisotropic depending on the strength of the magnetic scatterers in each direction. In the particular situation of magnetic impurities polarised in the x-direction, the conductivity is three times larger in y-direction as compared with the conductivity in the x-direction, for white noise scattering correlation function. We compare the approach we apply with the most commonly used way of dealing with more than one source of scattering, namely with Matthiessen's rule, and show that the approach we applied is more general and suitable for anisotropic scattering.",3
The tunable bandgap effect of SnS films.,"Two-dimensional (2D) SnS has attracted much attention as a phosphorene analogue due to the promising applications in next-generation nanoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. It has a bandgap of 1.3 eV, which is matched very well with incident solar radiation. To improve the switching character of devices, it is significant to modulate the bandgap of 2D SnS. In this work, potassium ion (K(+)) or calcium ion (Ca(2+)) is absorbed on the top surface of SnS films to produce an electric field, by which the bandgap can be tuned effectively. By first-principles method we studied the electronic properties and the modulation mechanism of bandgap in detail. The calculated ionization energy and formation energy are 0.41 eV and 0.26 eV for K (1.33 eV and 1.07 eV for Ca). Such little values indicate that it is feasible for ion absorbed on the surface to be used to modulate the bandgap of SnS films. Our calculations also show that the carrier mobility in plane of SnS films has a character of strong anisotropy and the electron mobility is very high in y direction (25.22 x 10(3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for SnS trilayer). Therefore 2D SnS has potential application in nanoelectronic and photovoltaic devices in the future. We hope our results will motivate experimental efforts of 2D SnS.",3
2D melting of confined colloids with a mixture of square and triangular order.,"We implement Brownian dynamics to investigate the melting processes of colloidal particles confined isotropically and interacting via a potential which can be tailored in a repulsive-attractive-respulsive fashion as the interparticle distance increases. The stable configurations of such a system is composed of a large diversity of structures, which includes quasicrystalline, triangular, square, and mixed orderings, as well as the presence of fringes and holes, which are located, respectively, at the border and interior of the clusters. Our simulations demonstrate that during the melting process particles are able to swing between different micro phases. This intermediary stage, present in a finite range of temperature, precedes the melting in all cases investigated and is different from the hexatic phase of the KTNHY framework. We also test the fringes stability and find it to be higher than the one found in compact clusters. Finally, we show that, at the high temperature regime, the system loses its angular ordering while still preserves its radial interparticle confinement, which, ultimately, causes the proliferation of small subclusters.",3
The effect of structural asymmetry on thermal rectification in nanostructures.,"Three SWCNT-graphene nanostructure-based models are designed to probe the thermal rectification caused by the structural asymmetry in the boundary thermal contacts, the device, and the whole system, respectively. We find that both the asymmetry of entire system and the asymmetry of the device are not necessary condition for the existence of thermal rectification, and the asymmetry in boundary thermal contacts is more important than the asymmetry in device toward determining both the magnitude and the direction of thermal rectification. Interestingly, notable thermal rectification can exist in the systems with overall structural symmetry when the boundary thermal contacts are structurally asymmetric. Moreover, nanostructures with a structurally symmetric device and structurally asymmetric boundary thermal contacts can still display significant thermal rectification. These findings could offer insight into the future design and performance improvement of nanostructured thermal rectifiers.",3
Unusual effects of Be doping in the iron-based superconductor FeSe.,"Recent superconducting transition temperatures (T c) over 100 K for monolayer FeSe on SrTiO3 have renewed interest in the bulk parent compound. In KCl:AlCl3 flux-transport-grown crystals of FeSe0.94Be0.06, FeSe0.97Be0.03 and, for comparison, FeSe, this work reports doping of FeSe using Be-among the smallest of possible dopants, corresponding to an effective 'chemical pressure'. According to lattice parameter measurements, 6% Be doping shrank the tetragonal FeSe lattice equivalent to a physical pressure of 0.75 GPa. Using this flux-transport method of sample preparation, 6% of Be was the maximum amount of dopant achievable. At this maximal composition of FeSe0.94Be0.06, the lattice unit cell shrinks by 2.4%, T c-measured in the bulk via specific heat-increases by almost 10%, the T c versus pressure behavior shifts its peak [Formula: see text] downwards by ~1 GPa, the high temperature structural transition around T S = 89 K increases by 1.9 K (in contrast to other dopants in FeSe which uniformly depress T S), and the low temperature specific heat gamma increases by 10% compared to pure FeSe. Also, upon doping by 6% Be the residual resistivity ratio, rho(300 K)/rho(T --> 0), increases by almost a factor of four, while rho(300 K)/rho([Formula: see text]) increases by 50%.",3
The effects of aerogen-bonding on the geometries and spectral properties of several small molecular clusters containing XeO3.,"Aerogen bonding, as a specific noncovalent interaction, has attracted wide attention recently. A number of theoretical studies have proposed this effect based on the analysis of electronic structures of aerogen-containing systems though, the spectral characteristics have not been identified, which becomes the obstacle for the experimental confirmation of this interaction. In this paper, we employed the density functional theory to explore the energetic and geometric properties, infrared, Raman spectra of five small molecular clusters XeO3.H2O, XeO3.NH3, XeO3 dimer, XeO3 trimer, and XeO3.2H2O. Our results show the binding energies of the most favorable conformations for the dimers are larger than -10.00 kcal mol(-1) and those for trimers are larger than -20.00 kcal mol(-1), which indicates the strong aerogen bonding is favorable for the stabilities of these clusters. More importantly, some new IR and Raman vibrations at fingerprint region (<1000 cm(-1)) are identified, which corresponds to the formation of aerogen bonds. This study provides a viable way for the experimentalists to characterize the aerogen bonding in future.",3
Multistep coupling of preexisting local ferroic distortions in PbTiO3 above the Curie temperature.,"Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic analyses were performed for the prominent ferroelectric PbTiO3 in the temperature range 130-1040 K, focusing particularly on its paraelectric state above the Curie temperature [Formula: see text] K. The temperature evolution of the anomalous Raman scattering reveals that not only local ferroic distortions persist at temperatures well above [Formula: see text], but also there is a sequence of different coupling processes preceding the appearance of long-range ferroelectric order at [Formula: see text]. Our results indicate that, similar to relaxor ferroelectrics, the paraelectric phase of PbTiO3 can be considered as an ergodic system of local ferroic distortions, which only on average appears to have cubic symmetry.",3
"Spin-polarized resonant surface state in (1 1 1) Sm1-x Gd x Al2, a zero-magnetization ferromagnet.","The electronic structure of (1 1 1) Sm1-x Gd x Al2, a zero-magnetization ferromagnet, is investigated by angle- and spin- resolved photoemission spectroscopy. An intense electron pocket strongly localized around [Formula: see text] and close to the Fermi level is observed and analyzed in detail. Its various characteristics, combined with electronic structure calculations, reveal a resonant surface state of 5d character and Lambda1 symmetry, likely built on bulk states developing around L points. It exhibits moreover a low temperature positive spin polarization at the Fermi level, of strong interest for spin-dependent transport properties in Sm1-x Gd x Al2-based spintronic devices.",3
Ab initio computer simulations of non-equilibrium radiation-induced cascades in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5.,"Ion irradiation corresponds to a process that involves the production of non-equilibrium cascades in the host material, and the atomistic modelling of such events in glasses is challenging. Here, non-equilibrium cascades in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 phase-change memory material have been investigated by means of first-principles molecular-dynamics simulations. A stochastic boundary-conditions approach is employed to treat the thermal nature of the cascades and drive the modelled system back to equilibrium in a natural way, while four different initial thermal-spike energies are considered. A comprehensive analysis of the cascade evolution is presented with respect to the kinetic profile and the dynamics of the cascade inside the glass structure. The modelling results show that the instantaneous maximum kinetic energy decays rapidly with time, and that the time-scale of the ballistic phase of the cascade inside the glass model is very short. The quality of the implemented approach is validated through a comparison of the calculated structure factor for the modelled glasses with experimental data from the literature. Analysis of the bonding for all the species in the glass structure highlights particular structural modifications in the connectivity of the amorphous network due to the simulated cascade.",3
Probing non-locality of interactions in a Bose-Einstein condensate using solitons.,"We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with non-local inter-particle interactions. The local Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation is valid for the gas parameter [Formula: see text], but for [Formula: see text], the BEC is described by a modified GP equation (MGPE). We study the exact solutions of the MGPE describing bright and dark solitons. It turns out that the width of these non-local solitons has qualitatively similar behaviour as the modified healing length due to the non-local interactions of the MGPE. We also study the effect of the non-locality and gas parameter (nu) on the stability of the solitons using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) stability criterion. We show that these soliton solutions are stable according to the VK criterion. Further, the stability of these soliton solutions gets enhanced due to the non-locality of interactions.",3
Compression mechanisms of ferroelectric PbTiO3 via high pressure neutron scattering.,"Switchable atomic displacements generate electric dipole moments in ferroelectric materials utilized in many contemporary devices. Lead titanate, a perovskite oxide with formula PbTiO3, has been referred to as a textbook example of a prototype displacive ferroelectric and is a testing platform of widely used models of piezoelectric response of complex solid-solutions. PbTiO3 has been addressed by experimental and computational studies, often with apparently conflicting conclusions. To date, hydrostatic pressure experiments have been interpreted in terms of a model in which the dipole moments gradually diminish with increasing pressure until a transition to a cubic phase, characterized by a zero average dipole moment, occurs. The model unrealistically assumes an even compression of the crystal. Here we show by high-pressure neutron powder diffraction measurements that a fast and slow shrinkage of 12-oxygen cages around Pb and octahedra around Ti, respectively, takes place. A phase diagram consolidating earlier and present results is given.",3
UV-induced formation of oxygen-derived dangling bonds on hydroxyl-terminated SiC.,"A combined theoretical and multi-technique experimental study was employed to comprehensively determine the electronic structure of 6H-SiC(0 0 0 1) surfaces upon hydroxyl and oxygen termination. We demonstrate the UV-induced formation of single-coordinated oxygen radicals in on-top sites above the atoms of the uppermost silicon layer of the substrate on initially hydroxyl-terminated SiC. Such a configuration of oxygen radicals represents an unprecedented adsorbate-derived system of unpaired electrons, bearing analogy to silicon and carbon dangling bonds on clean, unreconstructed SiC surfaces. We evidence the presence of adsorbate-derived surface states within the fundamental band gap for both hydroxyl- and oxygen-terminated SiC. For hydroxyl termination, a hydrogen-induced unoccupied surface state is revealed consistently by inverse photoemission spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations employing self-interaction-corrected pseudopotentials (DFT-SIC). The formation of oxygen dangling bonds is accompanied by the occurrence of an occupied surface state derived from p x - and p y -orbitals associated with the unpaired electrons as proven by both ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and DFT-SIC.",3
Magnetic structure and field-dependent magnetic phase diagram of Ni2In-type PrCuSi.,"The magnetic structure of the ternary equiatomic intermetallic compound PrCuSi is investigated using neutron powder diffraction experiments in 0 T as well as in external magnetic fields up to 2 T. The PrCuSi compound crystallizes in the hexagonal Ni2In-type structure, in the space group P63/mmc. In this structure, cationic ordering of Cu and Si takes place. The antiferromagnetic phase transition in the Pr sublattice takes place at [Formula: see text] K in 0 T. Under an external magnetic field of 2 T, a field-induced ferromagnetic phase is observed. Magnetoelastic coupling is evidenced by an increase in the unit cell volume. Clear signatures of a mixed antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phase in weak, intermediate fields, 0.4-0.8 T, are obtained from the present study. Using the present set of experimental data, we construct the H - T phase diagram of PrCuSi.",3
One-particle Green's function of interacting two electrons using analytic solutions for a three-body problem: comparison with exact Kohn-Sham system.,"For a three-electron system with finite-strength interactions confined to a one-dimensional harmonic trap, we solve the Schrodinger equation analytically to obtain the exact solutions, from which we construct explicitly the simultaneous eigenstates of the energy and total spin for the first time. The solutions for the three-electron system allow us to derive analytic expressions for the exact one-particle Green's function (GF) for the corresponding two-electron system. We calculate the GF in frequency domain to examine systematically its behavior depending on the electronic interactions. We also compare the pole structure of non-interacting GF using the exact Kohn-Sham (KS) potential with that of the exact GF to find that the discrepancy of the energy gap between the KS system and the original system is larger for a stronger interaction. We perform numerical examination on the behavior of GFs in real space to demonstrate that the exact and KS GFs can have shapes quite different from each other. Our simple model will help to understand generic characteristics of interacting GFs.",3
Interplay between nematic fluctuation and superconductivity in a two-orbital Hubbard model: a quantum Monte Carlo study.,"To understand the interplay between nematic fluctuation and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors, we performed a systematic study of the realistic two-orbital Hubbard model at intermedium correlation regimes by using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method. Our numerical results showed that the on-site nematic interaction induces a strong enhancement of nematic fluctuations at various momentums, especially at ([Formula: see text]). Simultaneously, it was found that the on-site nematic interaction suppresses the [Formula: see text] antiferromagnetic order and long-range electron pairing correlations for dominant pairing channels. Our findings suggest that on-site nematic fluctuation seems to compete with superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.",3
Controlling electron flow in anisotropic Dirac materials heterojunctions: a super-diverging lens.,"Ballistic heterojunctions of Dirac materials offer the opportunity of exploring optics-like phenomena in electronic systems. In this paper, a new perfect lens through special positive refraction is predicted with omnidirectional Klein tunneling of massless Dirac fermions. The novel optics component called a super-diverging lens (SDL) is the counterpart of a Veselago lens (VL). The use of SDL and VL creates a device that simulates the ocular vision. This atypical refraction is due to electrons obeying different Snell's laws of pseudo-spin and group velocity in heterojunctions with elliptical Dirac cones. These findings pave the way for an electron elliptical Dirac optics and open up new possibilities for the guiding of electrons.",3
Magnetic impurity in topological nodal loop semimetals.,"We investigate the Kondo effect of a spin-1/2 magnetic impurity in a topological nodal loop semimetal, in which band touchings form a nodal loop. The Fermi surface of a nodal loop semimetal is a torus or a drum-like structure, which is determined by chemical potential. When the chemical potential mu lies at the nodal loop ([Formula: see text]), the magnetic impurity and the conduction electrons form bound states only if their coupling exceeds a critical value. As the chemical potential is tuned away from the nodal loop, the Fermi surface becomes a torus or drum-like structure and the impurity and the host material always favor a bound state due to the finite density of state. Due to the anisotropic dispersion relationship in the energy band, the spatial spin-spin correlations [Formula: see text]([Formula: see text]) are of power-law decay with the decay rates proportional to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in different directions, respectively. The product [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] oscillates in coordinate space and the period is enhanced gradually as the Fermi surface evolves from a torus surface into a drum-like structure.",3
Geometric effect on quantum anomalous Hall states in magnetic topological insulators.,"An intriguing observation on the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is the dissipative edge states, where quantized Hall resistance is accompanied by nonzero longitudinal resistance. We numerically investigate this dissipative behavior of QAHE in MTIs with a three-dimensional tight-binding model and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. It is found that, in clean samples, the geometric mismatch between the detecting electrodes and the MTI sample leads to additional scattering in the central Hall bar, which is similar to the effect of splitting gates in the traditional Hall effect. As a result, while the Hall resistance remains quantized, the longitudinal resistance deviates from zero due to such additional scattering. It is also shown that external magnetic fields as well as disorder scattering can suppress the dissipation of the longitudinal resistance. These results are in good agreement with previous experimental observations and provide insight on the fabrication of QAHE devices.",3
Water entry and fall of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic Teflon spheres.,"Hydrophobic and superhydrophobic solid Teflon spheres have been observed while settling in water under the action of gravity, starting from different initial conditions, and have been followed until the steady-state is reached. The superhydrophobic sphere features a nano/microtextured surface and advancing and receding water contact angles equal to, respectively, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. When impacting water from air, both spheres can entrap a conspicuous amount of air deriving from the sealing of a macro-sized air cavity formed upon impact (air cavity trapping) and standing at the rear part of the settling sphere. It is shown that this air amount, like a spindle, reduces the force coefficient exerted on the sphere, basically acting on the pressure drag. However, the air cavity trapping occurs above a critical impact velocity which for the superhydrophobic spheres is significantly lower than that pertaining to the hydrophobic one; thus a certain range of impact velocities exists at which the superhydrophobic sphere experiences a lower pressure drag and a higher mean velocity. As soon as the air cavity vanishes, the dynamics of the superhydrophobic sphere becomes indistinguishable from that of the hydrophobic one, in spite of the persistence of air within the surface micro-texture.",3
Ineffectiveness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the dynamical quantum phase transition in the ITF model.,"Quantum phase transition occurs at a quantum critical value of a control parameter such as the magnetic field in the Ising model in a transverse magnetic field (ITF). Recently, it is shown that ramping across the quantum critical point generates non-analytic behaviors in the time evolution of a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature. The mentioned phenomenon is called the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Here, we consider the one-dimensional ITF model with added the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Using the fermionization technique, the Hamiltonian is exactly diagonalized. Although the DMI induces chiral phase in the ground state phase diagram of the model, the study of the rate function of the return probability has proven that the DMI does not affect the DQPT. We conclude accordingly that the ramping across the quantum critical point is not a necessary and sufficient condition for DQPT.",3
A phenomenological approach to the deposition pattern of evaporating droplets with contact line pinning.,"When an evaporating droplet of colloidal suspension dries on a solid surface with the contact line pinned, the solute particles are driven by the solvent flow toward the edge and form a ring-like deposition pattern. In this work, we take into account the contact angle hysteresis and incorporate it into the effective model of Man and Doi (2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 066101) which is based on Onsager's variational principle. We show that single-ring pattern is formed when the contact line pinning and/or friction are sufficiently strong. We demonstrate that there exists an appropriate range for contact line pinning and friction in which two rings can be formed in the deposition pattern, one at the initially pinned contact line and the other a bit closer to the center of droplet.",3
Heisenberg Ising-Kondo necklace model with transverse field for the heavy fermion compound URu2Si2.,"In this work, we introduce the Heisenberg Ising-Kondo necklace with transverse field as a possible model to describe the heavy-fermion compound URu2Si2. The physics of this compound presents many open questions, like the transition to the hidden order (HO) phase at T 0 = 17.5 K. Our Hamiltonian includes elements that come from crystal field processes and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. The main idea is to allow the transverse field, that a priori acts only in the localized moments, to influence the conduction-electrons via the RKKY interaction. Our results, obtained using a spin-wave approach for a one-dimensional lattice system, reveal a re-entrance behavior on the zero temperature phase diagram. This is an interesting result since combined with the magnetization values of the canted AF phase allow to link this phase with the mixed hidden order/large moment antiferromagnetic (HO/LMAF) phase observed in URu2Si2.",3
[Formula: see text] classification for a novel antiferromagnetic topological insulating phase in three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator.,"Antiferromagnetic topological insulator (AFTI) is a topological matter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Since its proposal, explorations of AFTI in strong-correlated systems are still lacking. In this paper, we show for the first time that a novel AFTI phase can be realized in three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator (TKI). In a wide parameter region, the ground states of TKI undergo a second-order transition to antiferromagnetic insulating phases which conserve a combined symmetry of time reversal and a lattice translation, allowing us to derive a [Formula: see text]-classification formula for these states. By calculating the [Formula: see text] index, the antiferromagnetic insulating states are classified into AFTI or non-topological antiferromagnetic insulator (nAFI) in different parameter regions. On the antiferromagnetic surfaces in AFTI, we find topologically protected gapless Dirac cones inside the bulk gap, leading to metallic Fermi rings exhibiting helical spin texture with weak spin-momentum locking. Depending on model parameters, the magnetic transitions take place either between AFTI and strong topological insulator, or between nAFI and weak topological insulator. By varying some model parameters, we find a topological transition between AFTI and nAFI, driving by closing of bulk gap. Our work may account for the pressure-induced magnetism in TKI compound SmB6, and helps to explore richer AFTI phases in heavy-fermion systems as well as in other strong-correlated systems.",3
Different regimes of the Purcell effect in disordered photonic crystals.,"We demonstrate that disorder in photonic crystals could lead to pronounced modification of spontaneous emission rate in the frequency region corresponding to the photonic band gap (PBG). Depending on the amount of disorder, two different regimes of the Purcell effect occurs. We provide statistical analysis of Purcell coefficient on the frequency of the emitter and its position within the sample. For the moderate disorder, an enhancement of spontaneous emission occurs at the edge of PBG due to the modification of properties of the edge state. This effect is responsible for recently observed mirrorless lasing in photonic crystals at the edge of PBG. When the level of disorder increases, the spontaneous emission rate enhances within the PBG due to the appearance of the high quality factor states. This effect is likely responsible for a superlinear dependence of emissions on pumping observed in synthetic opals.",3
Corrigendum to &quot;Effects of trigonal deformation on electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of bismuth&quot; [2018 J Phys Condens Matter 30 285504].,"In the mentioned paper [1], the cohesive energy E (eV/atom) as the function of the c/a in Table 3 should be corrected as follows.",3
"Electronic structure of Pr2MnNiO6 from x-ray photoemission, absorption and density functional theory.","The electronic structure of double perovskite Pr2MnNiO6 was studied using core x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The 2p x-ray absorption spectra show that Mn and Ni are in 4+ and 2+ states respectively. Based on charge transfer multiplet analysis of the 2p XPS spectra of both ions, we find charge transfer energies [Formula: see text] of 3.5 and 2.5 eV for Ni and Mn respectively. The ground state of Ni(2+) and Mn(4+) ions reveal a higher d electron count of 8.21 and 3.38 respectively as compared to the ionic values. The partial density of states clearly show a charge transfer character of the system for U - J [Formula: see text] 2 eV. The O 1s edge absorption spectra reveal a band gap of 0.9 eV, which is close to the value estimated from analysis of Ni and Mn 2p photoemission and absorption spectra. The combined analysis of nature of spectroscopic data and first principles calculations reveal that the material is a p - d type charge transfer insulator with an intermediate covalent character according to the Zannen-Sawatzy-Allen phase diagram.",3
Robust Hund rule without Coulomb repulsion and exclusion principle in quantum antiferromagnetic chains of composite half spins.,"Quantum spin chains with composite spins have been used to approximate conventional chains with higher spins. For instance, a spin 1 (or [Formula: see text]) chain was sometimes approximated by a chain with two (or three) spin [Formula: see text]'s per site. However, little examination has been given as to whether this approximation, effectively assuming the first Hund rule per site, is valid and why. In this paper, the validity of this approximation is investigated numerically. We diagonalize the Hamiltonians of spin chains with a spin 1 and [Formula: see text] per site and with two and three spin [Formula: see text]'s per site. The low energy excitation spectrum for the spin chain with M spin [Formula: see text]'s per site is found to coincide with that of the corresponding conventional chain with one spin [Formula: see text] per site. In particular, we find that as the system size increases, an increasingly larger block of consecutive lowest energy states with maximal spin per site is observed, robustly supporting the first Hund rule even though the exclusion principle does not apply and the system does not possess Coulomb repulsion. As for why this approximation works, we show that this effective Hund rule emerges as a plausible consequence when applying to composite spin systems the Lieb-Mattis theorem, which is originally for the ground state of ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin systems.",3
Tracer diffusion in crowded narrow channels.,"We summarise different results on the diffusion of a tracer particle in lattice gases of hard-core particles with stochastic dynamics, which are confined to narrow channels-single-files, comb-like structures and quasi-one-dimensional channels with the width equal to several particle diameters. We show that in such geometries a surprisingly rich, sometimes even counter-intuitive, behaviour emerges, which is absent in unbounded systems. This is well-documented for the anomalous diffusion in single-files. Less known is the anomalous dynamics of a tracer particle in crowded branching single-files-comb-like structures, where several kinds of anomalous regimes take place. In narrow channels, which are broader than single-files, one encounters a wealth of anomalous behaviours in the case where the tracer particle is subject to a regular external bias: here, one observes an anomaly in the temporal evolution of the tracer particle velocity, super-diffusive at transient stages, and ultimately a giant diffusive broadening of fluctuations in the position of the tracer particle, as well as spectacular multi-tracer effects of self-clogging of narrow channels. Interactions between a biased tracer particle and a confined crowded environment also produce peculiar patterns in the out-of-equilibrium distribution of the environment particles, very different from the ones appearing in unbounded systems. For moderately dense systems, a surprising effect of a negative differential mobility takes place, such that the velocity of a biased tracer particle can be a non-monotonic function of the force. In some parameter ranges, both the velocity and the diffusion coefficient of a biased tracer particle can be non-monotonic functions of the density. We also survey different results obtained for a tracer particle diffusion in unbounded systems, which will permit a reader to have an exhaustively broad picture of the tracer diffusion in crowded environments.",3
Theoretical investigation of multiferroic metal-organic framework magnet [CH3NH3][Co(HCOO)3]: Green's function method.,"For the first presented magnetic ordering-induced multiferroics with a metal-organic framework (MOF) of formula [CH3NH3][Co(HCOO)3], we theoretically investigate its multiple ferroics. It is found that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is a main cause that leads to non-zero magnetization, and electric polarization, and the induced electric polarization can be regulated by magnetic fields. As an assistant mechanism, magnon-magnon interaction and quantum fluctuation play an important role on ferroelectrics and magnetism. Our methods are based on the double-time Green's function and Holstein-Primakoff transformation. Theoretical results can be compared with experiments, though there are some discrepancies.",3
Anomalous heat flow in 8-Pmmn borophene with tilted Dirac cones.,"We analytically establish an anomalous transverse flow of heat in 8- Pmmn borophene, one of the several two-dimensional allotropes of Boron. The dispersion of this allotrope contains a pair of anisotropic and tilted Dirac cones which are gapped by placing the 2D B sheet under an intense circularly-polarized illumination. A gap in the Dirac dispersion leads to a finite Berry curvature and connected anomalous Hall effects. In the case of thermoelectrics, this manifests as a heat current perpendicular to the temperature gradient-the thermal Hall effect. A quantitative calculation of the attendant thermal Hall conductivity reveals dependence on the intrinsic anisotropy and tilt of the Dirac cone. Further, by estimating the longitudinal thermal conductivity using the Wiedemann-Franz law, we also outline steps to compute the thermal Hall angle that gauges the generation efficiency of such transverse heat processes. Finally, we touch upon the idea of thermal rectification wherein the direction of flow of the anomalous heat reverses through a simple switch of the polarization of incident light and is of interest in thermal logic circuits.",3
Peculiar magnetism in Eu substituted BiFeO3 and its correlation with local structure.,"We have systematically investigated the effects of Eu substitution on chemical pressure, bond lengths, microstrain, bond angles, octahedral tilting, vibrational modes and phase transformation, in BiFeO3. Correlation between concentration, phase, local structure and magnetism has been explained. Substitution of Eu ions with contrasting magnetic moment and dissimilar size, affects the local structure by changing bond angles and hence modifies spin structure through weakening of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction which lead to destruction of spiral spin configuration. Intriguing as well as anomalous magnetic response such as weak ferromagnetism with high coercivity, stair step like loops with significant drop in coercivity and systematic decrease in the magnetic coercivity at low temperatures has been observed as a function of Eu concentration (x). These results are explained on the basis of weakening of DM interaction, field induced melting of antiferromagnetic clusters and modification in effective magnetic anisotropy including contribution of magnetoelectric coupling, for various values of x. These results were used to generate the magnetic phase diagram.",3
Spin-orbital entangled liquid state in the copper oxide Ba3CuSb2O9.,"Structure with orbital degeneracy is unstable toward spontaneous distortion. Such orbital correlation usually has a much higher energy scale than spins, and therefore, magnetic transition takes place at a much lower temperature, almost independently from orbital ordering. However, when the energy scales of orbitals and spins meet, there is a possibility of spin-orbital entanglement that would stabilize novel ground state such as spin-orbital liquid and random singlet state. Here we review on such a novel spin-orbital magnetism found in the hexagonal perovskite oxide Ba3CuSb2O9, which hosts a self-organized honeycomblike short-range order of a strong Jahn-Teller ion Cu(2+). Comprehensive structural and magnetic measurements have revealed that the system has neither magnetic nor Jahn-Teller transition down to the lowest temperatures, and Cu spins and orbitals retain the hexagonal symmetry and paramagnetic state. Various macroscopic and microscopic measurements all indicate that spins and orbitals remain fluctuating down to low temperatures without freezing, forming a spin-orbital entangled liquid state.",3
"Variational study of the interacting, spinless Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.","We study the phase diagram and the total polarization distribution of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nearest neighbor interaction in one dimension at half-filling. To obtain the ground state wave-function, we extend the Baeriswyl variational wave function to account for alternating hopping parameters. The ground state energies of the variational wave functions compare well to exact diagonalization results. For the case of uniform hopping for all bonds, where it is known that an ideal conductor to insulator transition takes place at finite interaction, we also find a transition at an interaction strength somewhat lower than the known value. The ideal conductor phase is a Fermi sea. The phase diagram in the whole parameter range shows a resemblance to the phase diagram of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. We also calculate the gauge invariant cumulants corresponding to the polarization (Zak phase) and use these to reconstruct the distribution of the polarization. We calculate the reconstructed polarization distribution along a path in parameter space which connects two points with opposite polarization in two ways. In one case we cross the metallic phase line, in the other, we go through only insulating states. In the former case, the average polarization changes discontinuously after passing through the metallic phase line, while in the latter the distribution 'walks across' smoothly from one polarization to its opposite. This state of affairs suggests that the correlation acts to break the chiral symmetry of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, in the same way as it happens when a Rice-Mele onsite potential is turned on.",3
Coherent transport in Y-junction graphene waveguide.,"We performed a series of theoretical transport studies on Y-branch electron waveguides which are embedded in mid-size armchair graphene nanoribbons. Non-equilibrium Green's function with different approximations of tight-binding Hamiltonian has been employed. Using the first nearest hopping approximation, we observed very pronounced conductance quantization, the structure of which depends on geometrical design and shows a spacing of 4e (2)/h, indicating the existence of valley degree of freedom. Moreover, by incorporating the third nearest approximation, we observed seminal plateaus deviated from multiples of 4e (2)/h conductance, suggesting the lift of valley degeneracy. Finally, Quasi-one dimensional band structure calculations have been performed to study the availability of energy channels and the role of the major geometrical parameters on the transport.",3
Magnetism of Bi2Se3 thin films with Eu-rich flat inclusions.,"We report the results of experimental and theoretical studies of Eu-doped Bi2Se3 thin films with extremely inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic component. The obtained electron microscopy images suggest that Eu atoms are concentrated within platelet-like nanoinclusions. The number of inclusions grows with the increase in Eu content, x. Moreover, at relatively high x values, the stacks of platelets (inclusions located one under another) become rather frequent. A comparative analysis of magnetic properties of the films under study reveals no pronounced changes of their temperature dependence with the increase in x, which, however, leads to the decrease in the average magnetic moment [Formula: see text] per Eu atom. A theoretical analysis of different mechanisms contributing to a possible magnetic ordering in the Eu-doped films demonstrates that at small distances (i.e. within a platelet) a dominant contribution is related to the RKKY interaction via electrons in the bulk, while the ordering at inter-platelet distances is governed by magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. The latter implies the antiferromagnetic ordering within the stacks of platelets explaining a drop of [Formula: see text] per Eu atom. We employ the model of a metallic spin glass to estimate the transition temperature, characterising the interaction within the ensemble of randomly distributed magnetic platelets. This estimate gives satisfactory agreement with the experiment, even if we take into account a finite film thickness, thus, neglecting the interaction anisotropy and including only the antiferromagnetism related to the stacking. While the overall contribution of interface Dirac electrons is damped in the systems under study, we argue that the obtained results can be used for the investigation of ultrathin films with analogous impurity profile, where this contribution should be clearly pronounced.",3
Vibrational dynamics within the embedded-atom-method formalism and the relationship to Born-von-Karman force constants.,"We derive expressions for the dynamical matrix of a crystalline solid with total potential energy described by an embedded-atom-method (EAM) potential. We make no assumptions regarding the number of atoms per unit cell. These equations can be used for calculating both bulk phonon modes as well the modes of a slab of material, which is useful for the study of surface phonons. We further discuss simplifications that occur in cubic lattices with one atom per unit cell. The relationship of Born-von-Karman (BvK) force constants-which are readily extracted from experimental vibrational dispersion curves-to the EAM potential energy is discussed. In particular, we derive equations for BvK force constants for bcc and fcc lattices in terms of the functions that define an EAM model. The EAM-BvK relationship is useful for assessing the suitability of a particular EAM potential for describing vibrational spectra, which we illustrate using vibrational data from the bcc metals K and Fe and the fcc metal Au.",3
Electronic structure and migration of interstitial hydrogen in the rutile phase of TiO2.,"The formation and migration energies of interstitial hydrogen in rutile TiO2 are obtained from first principles calculations. The computational approach was based on density functional theory with a semilocal generalised-gradient approximation functional, supplemented with an on-site Hubbard term to account for correlation among the Ti 3d electrons. Charge-transition levels are calculated and compared to previous theoretical studies. The donor character of hydrogen is examined in depth, focusing in particular on the tendency to form polaron-like configurations with the unpaired electron trapped at nearby titanium ions. Distinct minimum-energy paths of hydrogen migration and associated energy barriers were determined by the nudged elastic-band method. The present findings show clearly the strong anisotropy in the energy barriers for migration within the open c channels as opposed to migration crossing adjacent channels of the rutile lattice. For the rate-limiting step which leads to macroscopic diffusion along the c axis the corresponding rate and diffusion coefficient were also determined from transition-state theory. The results are discussed in connection to existing measurements of hydrogen diffusion and recent findings from electron paramagnetic resonance, electron-nuclear double resonance and muonium spectroscopies that probed the spatial localization of the electron spin.",3
First-principles study of electronic properties of Cu doped Ag2S.,"Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, electronic properties of Ag2S and Cu doped Ag2S were investigated. The calculated results show that Ag2S crystal is semiconductor with a band gap of 0.92 eV which is consistent with previous PBE calculation. Three possible Cu doping configurations are investigated: Cu substitution of Ag_I, Cu substitution of Ag_II, and interstitial Cu. It is found that interstitial Cu doping reduces the band gap as the Cu concentration increases, while for Ag_I and Ag_II substitution doping the band gap is not sensitive to the impurity concentration. The band gap reduction can mainly be attributed to the downward shift of the bottom of conduction band upon Cu interstitial doping. The reduction of the band gap for Ag2S with interstitial Cu doping is consistent with experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra, where a significant red-shift after Cu doping in Ag2S crystal is observed.",3
Corrections to the magnetoresistance formula for semimetals with Dirac electrons: the Boltzmann equation approach validated by the Kubo formula.,"The magnetoresistance (MR) in semimetals with Dirac (or Weyl) electrons and free holes is investigated on the basis of the Boltzmann theory. The MR is modified from the conventional results with free electrons and holes in a very complex way due to the correction of the Dirac dispersion. The obtained formula explicitly includes the magnetic field dependence, which is very useful for the analysis of experimental results. In order to verify the validity of our results, the results obtained by the Boltzmann approach are compared with those by the Kubo theory. It is revealed that, by taking into account the field dependence of carrier density, the MR obtained by the Boltzmann theory almost perfectly agrees with that based on the Kubo theory even in the high-field region (in the quantum limit) except for the quantum oscillations. It is also shown that the MR in semimetals increases linearly with respect to the field in the quantum limit due to the drastic change of the carrier density, which is a significant characteristic of semimetals.",3
Nanometrology of field gradient using donor spins in silicon.,"We proposed a novel scheme for nanometrology of magnetic field gradient based on Kane's silicon quantum computer proposal. When the system is placed in an unknown magnetic field gradient, the inhomogeneous precession of the donor nuclear spins records the field gradient information to the phase pattern of donor nuclear spins. By adding AC voltage modulations on each A-gate to induce hyperfine-mediated electron-nuclear collective flip-flop process, we demonstrate that the gradient value can be obtained by tuning the modulation phases of the A-gates. Errors of the measurements of such scheme is discussed and estimated. It is also discussed that in presence of the external field with a known gradient, the same system is possible to be used to obtain the unknown displacement of donor locations.",3
Squeezing and time evolution of magnon states under perpendicular pumping.,"The coherent magnon state representation is employed to investigate the quantum-statistical behavior of the nonlinear excitation of magnons in ferromagnets. Both the long-range magnetic dipole-dipole and short-range exchange interactions are included, along with a static longitudinal applied field and a microwave pumping field in the perpendicular orientation. Within a microscopic (or Hamiltonian-based) approach the total Hamiltonian is transformed from spin operators to a normal-mode set of boson creation and annihilation operators. When the three-magnon interactions are included, it is found that the microwave pumping field may be used to control the nonlinear statistical properties of the system. From a study of the time evolution of the system we deduce the average number of magnons, the super-Poissonian statistical behavior, and the occurrence of magnon squeezing. We also compare the results with the case where the microwave pumping field is in the parallel orientation, and it is found that there are important differences in the time dependence.",3
Dielectric properties of ferroelectric nanocomposites: effects of thermal stresses and filler shape anisotropy.,"Ferroelectric nanocomposites are intriguing nonhomogeneous materials, which may have unusual phase states and specific physical properties useful for practical applications. Here we theoretically describe dielectric properties of nanocomposites comprising single-domain ferroelectric nanocrystals embedded into a linear dielectric medium. First, small-signal intrinsic permittivities of spheroidal PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 crystallites surrounded by an isotropic matrix with linear elastic properties are calculated with the aid of a nonlinear thermodynamic theory. It is shown that thermal stresses caused by differences in thermal expansion between the inclusions and the matrix may strongly influence the intrinsic permittivities of ferroelectric nanocrystals. Second, macroscopic dielectric responses of ferroelectric-dielectric composites are evaluated in the Maxwell Garnett approximation. For effective permittivities of such composites, generalized relations are derived, which allow for both the shape and dielectric anisotropies of ferroelectric nanocrystals. Numerical calculations of the effective permittivities are performed for composites comprising PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 nanocrystals embedded into representative dielectric matrices generating tensile (silica glass) or compressive (potassium silicate glass) thermal stresses inside ferroelectric inclusions. For nanocomposites involving randomly oriented and similarly aligned spheroidal inclusions, temperature dependences of the effective permittivities are determined with the account of phase transitions occurring in strained ferroelectric nanocrystals and suppression of their dielectric responses due to the depolarizing-field effect created by low-permittivity matrix. Our theoretical calculations show that effective permittivities of composites comprising needle-like or disc-shaped ferroelectric inclusions could strongly exceed the permittivity of the matrix. Most importantly, we predict that BaTiO3-K2O-SiO2 composites with such inclusions should exhibit a broad dielectric peak around the room temperature, which is associated with shifted structural transitions in strained BaTiO3 nanocrystals. The presented theory provides guidelines for the development of ferroelectric nanocomposites with enhanced dielectric responses, which could be suitable for applications in supercapacitors and other advanced electronic devices.",3
Estimation of the infinitesimal generator by square-root approximation.,"In recent years, for the analysis of molecular processes, the estimation of time-scales and transition rates has become fundamental. Estimating the transition rates between molecular conformations is-from a mathematical point of view-an invariant subspace projection problem. We present a method to project the infinitesimal generator acting on function space to a low-dimensional rate matrix. This projection can be performed in two steps. First, we discretize the conformational space in a Voronoi tessellation, then the transition rates between adjacent cells is approximated by the geometric average of the Boltzmann weights of the Voronoi cells. This method demonstrates that there is a direct relation between the potential energy surface of molecular structures and the transition rates of conformational changes. We will show also that this approximation is correct and converges to the generator of the Smoluchowski equation in the limit of infinitely small Voronoi cells. We present results for a two dimensional diffusion process and alanine dipeptide as a high-dimensional system.",3
The Kondo resonance line shape in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy: instrumental aspects.,"In the scanning tunnelling microscope, the many-body Kondo effect leads to a zero-bias feature of the differential conductance spectra of magnetic adsorbates on surfaces. The intrinsic line shape of this Kondo resonance and its temperature dependence in principle contain valuable information. We use measurements on a molecular Kondo system, all- trans retinoic acid on Au(1 1 1), and model calculations to discuss the role of instrumental broadening. The modulation voltage used for the lock-in detection, noise on the sample voltage, and the temperature of the microscope tip are considered. These sources of broadening affect the apparent line shapes and render difficult a determination of the intrinsic line width, in particular when variable temperatures are involved.",3
The relation between local structural distortion and the low-temperature magnetic anomaly in Fe7S8.,"Structural defects on an atomic level can crucially impact the magnetic properties of a material. We study this phenomenon by means of magnetometry and powder neutron diffraction on a stoichiometric, monoclinic pyrrhotite (Fe7S8), which is a classic omission structure with a magnetic anomaly at about 30 K. The initial structural distortion of the pyrrhotite at 300 K caused by the vacancy arrangement decreases upon cooling, and simultaneous to the magnetic anomaly the anisotropic contraction of the unit cell homogenizes the covalency of the Fe-Fe bonds with lengths less than 3.0 A and the Fe-S-Fe bond angles. These changes on the atomic level affect the spin-orbit coupling and the super-exchange interactions in Fe7S8, and trigger the low-temperature magnetic anomaly within a crystallographically stable system.",3
Formation and stability of water clusters at the molybdenum disulfide interface: a molecular dynamics simulation investigation.,"In this work structural properties and dynamic behavior of a water nano droplet on the molybdenum disulfide were considered. The simulation results show that water molecules form polygon clusters on the interface, and most of which are hexagonal. Structures of water clusters at the interface are seen in two forms of curved and flattened polygons, which result in the formation of hydrogen bonds between and in the adjacent layers, respectively. Most of the clusters have circular flattened structures. Calculations of the lifetime of hydrogen bonds of water molecules at the interface also show that hydrogen bonds between water molecules at the interface have a low stability. This leads to the permanent formation and breaking down of hydrogen bonds of water molecules which can cause movement of water molecules and, consequently, the displacement of the center of mass and droplet motion. Considering the changes in the center of mass of a water droplet at the MoS2 interface display, the water droplet has a significant spontaneous motion.",3
From Klein to anti-Klein tunneling in graphene tuning the Rashba spin-orbit interaction or the bilayer coupling.,"We calculate the transmission coefficient for a particle crossing a potential barrier in monolayer graphene with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in bilayer graphene. We show that in both cases one can go from Klein tunneling regime, characterized by perfect normal transmission, to anti-Klein tunneling regime, with perfect normal reflection, by tuning the Rashba spin-orbit coupling for a monolayer or the interplane coupling for a bilayer graphene. We show that the intermediate regime is characterized by a non-monotonic behavior with oscillations and resonances in the normal transmission amplitude as a function of the coupling and of the potential parameters.",3
Isolated highly localized bands in YBi2 monolayer caused by 4f orbitals.,"The novel electronic structures can induce unique physical properties in two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, we report isolated highly localized bands (HLB) in [Formula: see text] monolayer by the first-principle calculations within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is found that [Formula: see text] monolayer is an indirect-gap semiconductor using both GGA and GGA+SOC. The calculations reveal that Yb-4f orbitals constitute isolated HLB below the Fermi level at the absence of SOC, and the bands are split into the j = 7/2 and j = 5/2 states with SOC. The isolated HLB can lead to a very large Seebeck coefficient and very low electrical conductivity in p-type doping by producing very large effective mass of the carrier. It is proved that isolated HLB have very strong stability against strain, which is very important for practical application. When the onsite Coulomb interaction is added to the Yb-4f orbitals, isolated HLB persist, and only their relative positions in the gap change. These findings open a new window to search for novel electronic structures in 2D materials.",3
Spin waves in disordered materials.,"We present an efficient methodology to study spin waves in disordered materials. The approach is based on a Heisenberg model and enables calculations of magnon properties in spin systems with disorder of an arbitrary kind and concentration of impurities. Disorder effects are taken into account within two complementary approaches. Magnons in systems with substitutional (uncorrelated) disorder can be efficiently calculated within a single-site coherent potential approximation for the Heisenberg model. From the computation point of view the method is inexpensive and directly applicable to systems like alloys and doped materials. It is shown that it performs exceedingly well across all concentrations and wave vectors. Another way is the direct numerical simulation of large supercells using a configurational average over possible samples. This approach is applicable to systems with an arbitrary kind of disorder. The effective interaction between magnetic moments entering the Heisenberg model can be obtained from first-principles using a self-consistent Green function method within the density functional theory. Thus, our method can be viewed as an ab initio approach and can be used for calculations of magnons in real materials.",3
Shifted Landau levels in curved graphene sheets.,"We study the Landau levels in curved graphene sheets by measuring the discrete energy spectrum in the presence of a magnetic field. We observe that in rippled graphene sheets, the Landau energy levels satisfy the same square root dependence on the energy quantum number as in flat sheets, [Formula: see text]. Though, we find that the Landau levels in curved sheets are shifted towards lower energies by an amount proportional to the average spatial deformation of the sheet. Our findings are relevant for the quantum Hall effect in curved graphene sheets, which is directly related to Landau quantization. For the purpose of this study, we develop a new numerical method, based on the quantum lattice Boltzmann method, to solve the Dirac equation on curved manifolds, describing the low-energetic states in strained graphene sheets.",3
"Electronic properties of the two-dimensional (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] compound having a honeycomb-like structure.","Heavy metal layers having a honeycomb structure on the Si(1 1 1) surface were theoretically predicted to show prospects for possessing properties of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators. The (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] atomic-layer compound synthesized in the present work is the first real system of such type, where atoms of heavy metal Tl are arranged into the honeycomb structure stabilized by Rb atoms occupying the centers of the honeycomb units. Electronic properties of the (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] compound has been fully characterized experimentally and theoretically and compared with those of the hypothetical (Tl, H)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] prototype system. It is concluded that the QSH-insulator properties of the Tl-honeycomb layers on Si(1 1 1) surface are dictated by the stable adsorption sites occupied by Tl atoms which, in turn, are controlled by the atom species centering the Tl honeycombs. As a result, the real (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] compound where Tl atoms occupy the T4 sites does not possess QSH-insulator properties in contrast to the hypothetical (Tl, H)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] system where Tl atoms reside in the T1 (on-top) sites and it shows up as a QSH material.",3
Phonon fingerprints of CsPb2Br5.,"CsPb2Br5 is a stable, water-resistant, material derived from CsPbBr3 perovskite and featuring two-dimensional Pb-Br framework separated by Cs layers. Both compounds can coexist at nanolength scale, which often produces conflicting optical spectroscopy results. We present a complete set of polarized Raman spectra of nonluminescent CsPb2Br5 single crystals that reveals the symmetry and frequency of nondegenerate Raman active phonons accessible from the basal (0 0 1) plane. The experimental results are in good agreement with density functional perturbation theory simulations, which suggests that the calculated frequencies of yet unobserved double degenerate Raman and infrared phonons are also reliable. Unlike CsPbBr3, the lattice dynamics of CsPb2Br5 is stable as evidenced by the calculated phonon dispersion. The sharp Raman lines and lack of a dynamic-disorder-induced central peak in the spectra at room temperature indicate that the coupling of Cs anharmonic motion to Br atoms, known to cause the dynamic disorder in CsPbBr3, is absent in CsPb2Br5.",3
Boltzmann approach to spin-orbit-induced transport in effective quantum theories.,"In model studies of the spin/anomalous Hall effect, effective Hamiltonians often serve as the starting point. However, a complete effective quantum theory contains not only the effective Hamiltonian but also the relation linking the physical observables to the canonical ones. In this work we construct the semiclassical Boltzmann transport framework in the weak disorder-potential regime directly in the level of the effective quantum theory, and confirm this construction by formulating a generalized Kohn-Luttinger density matrix transport theory also in this level. The link and difference between the present theory and previous phenomenological Boltzmann, quantum kinetic and usual Kubo-Streda theories are clarified. In the application to a two-dimensional Rashba electron effective model, a nonzero spin Hall effect important in the case of strong Rashba coupling but neglected in previous theories is found.",3
Parity-breaking in single-element phases: ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals.,"Polar metals based on binary and ternary compounds have been demonstrated in literature. Here, we propose a design principle for ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals and relate it to real materials. The design principle is that, to be an elemental polar metal, atoms should occupy at least two inequivalent Wyckoff positions in a crystal with a polar space group, where inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken. According to this rule, we propose the first class of potential ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals in a distorted alpha-La-like structure with a polar space group P63 mc in which two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a (0, 0, z) and 2b (1/3, 2/3, z) are occupied by group-V elements (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Analyses based on first-principles calculations indicate that the dynamically stable polar phase results from a lone pair driven polar distortion of the nonploar phase in P63/mmc symmetry where two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a (0, 0, 0) and 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4) are occupied. This ferroelectric-like transition involves a transition from a metallic state to a semimetallic state. These predicted polar phases are metastable with respect to their corresponding ground phases. Moreover, ionic bonding characters are found due to the inequivalence in Wyckoff positions between group-V atoms. Our work opens a route to single-element parity-breaking phases.",3
Evolution of the magnetic order of Fe and Eu sublattices in Eu1-x Ca x Fe2As2 (0 x 1) single crystals.,"Single crystals of Eu1-x Ca x Fe2As2 ([Formula: see text]) are grown using the high-temperature solution-growth method employing FeAs self-flux. Structural and chemical analysis indicates that these crystals are homogeneous and their lattice parameters exhibit a gradual monotonic decrease with increasing Ca concentration. Detailed magnetic, specific heat and resistivity data were used to construct a phase diagram which depicts the evolution of the structural/spin-density-wave transition at T 0, and of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperature of the Eu moments at T N. We found out that while T N decreases monotonically from 19.1 K (for x = 0) to below 2 K (for [Formula: see text]), T 0 remains almost constant up to x = x c and decreases steadily for higher values of x. Annealing at low temperatures for several days leads to enhancement of T N and T 0 by a few kelvin and sharpened the anomalies associated with these transitions. However, annealing did not change the variation of T N and T 0 across the series. The observation that T 0 is almost constant until the long-range AFM ordering of the Eu(2+) moments gets destroyed, suggests a subtle interrelationship between the Eu(2+) and Fe(2+) magnetic sublattices.",3
On the incorporation of iron into hexagonal barium titanate: I. electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study.,"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) investigations of BaTiO3 + 0.04 BaO + x/2 Fe2O3 (0.007 x 0.05) ceramics and BaTi0.98Fe0.02O3 single crystals were performed to study the incorporation of Fe ions in the hexagonal 6H-BaTiO3 lattice and their defect properties. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction and wavelength-dispersive x-ray electron probe microanalysis. EPR spectra were recorded both in X- and Q-bands at room temperature. Angle-dependent single crystal EPR investigations and simulations of the ceramic powder EPR spectra revealed three different centers, which can be attributed to Fe(3+) ions incorporated on crystallographically different Ti sites. Only one of them was already known before. Two spectra with axial symmetry belong to isolated Fe(3+) ions incorporated at Ti(1) sites (exclusively corner-sharing oxygen octahedra) and Ti(2) sites (face-sharing octahedra). The difference of their spectral parameters arises from the different trigonal distortions of the two types of octahedra. The third spectrum has orthorhombic symmetry and is caused by Fe(3+) centers associated with a nearest-neighbor charge-compensating oxygen vacancy. A model for the location of this associate is proposed.",3
Probing interface localization-delocalization transitions by colloids.,"Interface localization-delocalization transitions (ILDT) occur in two-phase fluids confined in a slit with competing preferences of the walls for the two fluid phases. At low temperatures the interface between the two phases is localized at one of the walls. Upon increasing temperature it unbinds. Although intensively studied theoretically and computationally, such transitions have not yet been observed experimentally due to severe challenges in resolving fine details of the fluid structure. Here, using mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model, we propose to detect these ILDT by using colloids. We show that the finite-size and fluctuation induced force acting on a colloid confined in such a system experiences a vivid change if, upon lowering the temperature, the interface localizes at one of the walls. This change can serve as a more easily accessible experimental indicator of the transition.",3
Excitation energy transport with noise and disorder in a model of the selectivity filter of an ion channel.,"A selectivity filter is a gate in ion channels that is responsible for the selection and fast conduction of particular ions across the membrane (with high throughput rates of 10(8) ions s(-1) and a high 1:10(4) discrimination rate between ions). It is made of four strands as the backbone, and each strand is composed of sequences of five amino acids connected by peptide units H-N-C=O in which the main molecules in the backbone that interact with ions in the filter are carbonyl (C=O) groups that mimic the transient interactions of ion with binding sites during ion conduction. It has been suggested that quantum coherence and possible emergence of resonances in the backbone carbonyl groups may play a role in mediating ion conduction and selectivity in the filter. Here, we investigate the influence of noise and disorder on the efficiency of excitation energy transfer (EET) in a linear harmonic chain of N = 5 sites with dipole-dipole couplings as a simple model for one P-loop strand of the selectivity filter backbone in biological ion channels. We include noise and disorder inherent in real biological systems by including spatial disorder in the chain, and random noise within a weak coupling quantum master equation approach. Our results show that disorder in the backbone considerably reduces EET, but the addition of noise helps to recover high EET for a wide range of system parameters. Our analysis may help for better understanding of the coordination of ions in the filter as well as the fast and efficient functioning of the selectivity filters in ion channels.",3
Time-reversal symmetry-breaking in noncentrosymmetric superconductors.,"In this paper we examine the appearance of time-reversal symmetry-breaking (TRSB) states in the bulk and at the surface of a noncentrosymmetric superconductor. We utilize a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with coefficients derived from a microscopic model of the superconductor. We show that suppression of the triplet order parameter at the surface stabilizes a TRSB state by locally tuning the system into the bulk TRSB phase. We compare these results with those from centrosymmetric systems, and examine the appearance of a magnetization at the surface.",3
Spot-beam effect in grazing atom-surface collisions: from quantum to classical.,"Grazing incidence fast atom diffraction (GIFAD) is a sensitive tool for surface analysis, which strongly relies on the quantum coherence of the incident beam. In this article we study the spot-beam effect, due to contributions coming from different positions of the focus point of the incident particles, which affects the coherence of GIFAD spectra. We show that the influence of the spot-beam effect on GIFAD patterns depends on the width of the surface area that is coherently lighted by the atomic beam. While for extended illuminations the spot-beam contribution plays a minor role, when a narrow surface area is coherently lighted, the spot-beam effect allows projectiles to explore different zones of a single crystallographic channel, bringing to light intra-channel interference structures. In this last case the spot-beam effect gives also rise to a non-coherent background, which deteriorates the visibility of the interference structures. We found that by varying the impact energy, while keeping the same collimating setup, it is possible to switch gradually from quantum to classical projectile distributions. Present results are compared with available experimental data, making evident that the inclusion of focusing effects is necessary for the proper theoretical description of the experimental spectra.",3
Observation and interpretation of negative remanent magnetization and inverted hysteresis loops in a thin film of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3.,The observation of inverted magnetic hysteresis loops and negative magnetic remanence (NRM) in a 7.6 nm thin film of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 grown on SrTiO3 substrates is reported. The film was grown employing pulsed laser deposition and characterized by reflection high-energy electron diffraction during growth and using x-ray reflectivity measurements post-growth. Magnetic properties of the film were measured from 5 K to 400 K under both the field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) conditions. The observed results of inverted magnetic hysteresis loops and NRM are interpreted in terms of the co-existence of a magnetically inhomogeneous region consisting of superparamagnetic spin clusters with a blocking temperature T B = 240 K and the ferromagnetic state with an ordering temperature T C = 290 K. Hysteresis loop inversion is observed in the temperature region of T B < T < T C whereas NRM appears in the mixed superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic states for T < T C down to 5 K. These observations of hysteresis loop inversion and NRM are related to the magneto-static interaction between the superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic phases leading to anti-alignment of spin of both magnetic phases with respect to each other.,3
Drude weight and superconducting weight.,"The Drude weight D (also called charge stiffness) measures the effective electron density contributing to dc conductivity; it vanishes in insulators. It is a general concept, which applies to any metal, including cases with disorder and electron-electron interaction. We provide a thorough analysis of D and of its meaning, both in the general case and in the special case of band metals, where we also show that D has a close relationship to orbital magnetization. The superconducting weight D s measures instead the superfluid density accounting for the Meissner effect. The two quantities D and D s are the main criteria to discriminate between insulators, metals, and superconductors.",3
A theoretical study of substitutional boron-nitrogen clusters in diamond.,"Substitutional clusters of multiple light element dopants are a promising route to the elusive shallow donor in diamond. To understand the behaviour of co-dopants, this report presents an extensive first principles study of possible clusters of boron and nitrogen. We use periodic hybrid density functional calculations to predict the geometry, stability and electronic excitation energies of a range of clusters containing up to five N and/or B atoms. Excitation energies from hybrid calculations are compared to those from the empirical marker method, and are in good agreement. When a boron-rich or nitrogen-rich cluster consists of three to five atoms, the minority dopant element-a nitrogen or boron atom respectively-can be in either a central or peripheral position. We find B-rich clusters are most stable when N sits centrally, whereas N-rich clusters are most stable with B in a peripheral position. In the former case, excitation energies mimic those of the single boron acceptor, while the latter produce deep levels in the band-gap. Implications for probable clusters that would arise in high-pressure high-temperature co-doped diamond and their properties are discussed.",3
Low lattice thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric behavior in Li3Sb and Li3Bi.,"Utilizing the first-principle calculations combined with Boltzmann transport equation and semiclassical analysis, we present a systematic investigation of the electron structure, lattice thermal conductivity [Formula: see text], Seebeck coefficient S, and the dimensionless figure of merit ZT of crystal Li3Sb and Li3Bi. The [Formula: see text] of 2.2 and 2.09 W m(-1) K(-1) are obtained at room temperature in Li3Sb and Li3Bi systems with the band gap of [Formula: see text] eV, respectively. The low [Formula: see text] can induce excellent thermoelectric properties. Thus the effect of doping on the transport properties has been judiciously researched and the maximum ZT of 2.42, 1.54 is obtained at 900 K in the p-type doped Li3Sb and p-type doped Li3Bi with the stable structures. Up to date, experimental finding of the maximum ZT is 2.6 at 850 K in the Cu2Se sample with 1 mol indium, our results are very close to this value. This letter provides insight into the thermal transport properties of Li3Sb and Li3Bi, meanwhile, supports that crystalline Li3Sb and Li3Bi may be promising materials for thermoelectric devices and application.",3
The low-temperature heat capacity of the Sb2Te3-x Se x solid solution from experiment and theory.,"The lattice dynamics of Sb2Te3-x Se x (x = 0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 3) mixed crystals have been studied by a combination of low-temperature heat-capacity measurements between 2-300 K and first-principles calculations. The results from the experimental and theoretical investigations are in excellent agreement. While Sb2Se3 can be considered as a harmonic lattice oscillator in this temperature range, for the isostructural compounds Sb2Te3, Sb2Se0.6Te2.4, Sb2Se1.2Te1.8 and Sb2Se1.8Te1.2 (tetradymite structure type; R [Formula: see text] m) a small anharmonic contribution to the total heat capacity has to be taken into account at temperatures above 250 K. For the compounds which crystallize in the tetradymite structure type the experimental and theoretical data show unambiguously that the exchange of Te by Se leads to an increase of the bonding polarity and consequently to a hardening of the bonding which is reflected in an increase of the Debye temperatures with increasing Se contents. In addition, our studies clearly demonstrate that the mixed crystals in the stability field of the tetradymite structure type are characterized by a strong non-ideal mixing behavior.",3
"Antiferromagnetic spin-frustrated layers of corner-sharing Cu4 tetrahedra on the kagome lattice in volcanic minerals Cu5O2(VO4)2(CuCl), NaCu5O2(SeO3)2Cl3, and K2Cu5Cl8(OH)4.2H2O.","The objective of the present work was to analyze the possibility of realization of quantum spin liquids in three volcanic minerals-averievite (Cu5O2(VO4)2(CuCl)), ilinskite (NaCu5O2(SeO3)2Cl3), and avdononite (K2Cu5Cl8(OH)4.2H2O)-from the crystal chemistry point of view. Based on the structural data, the sign and strength of magnetic interactions have been calculated and the geometric frustrations serving as the main reason of the existence of spin liquids have been investigated. According to our calculations, the magnetic structures of averievite and ilinskite are composed of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-frustrated layers of corner-sharing Cu4 tetrahedra on the kagome lattice. However, the direction of nonshared corners of tetrahedra is different in them. The oxygen ions centering the OCu4 tetrahedra in averievite and ilinskite provide the main contribution to the formation of AFM interactions along the tetrahedra edges. The local electric polarization in averievite and the possibility of spin configuration fluctuations due to vibrations of tetrahedra-centering oxygen ions have been discussed. The existence of structural phase transitions accompanied with magnetic transitions was assumed in ilinskite because of the effect of a lone electron pair by Se(4+) ions. As was demonstrated through comparison of averievite and avdoninite, at the removal of centering oxygen ions from tetrahedra, the magnetic structure of the pyrochlore layer present in averievite transformed into an openwork curled net with large cells woven from corner-sharing open AFM spin-frustrated tetrahedra ('butterflies') in avdoninite.",3
Functionalization and passivation of ultrathin alumina films of defined sub-nanometer thickness with self-assembled monolayers.,"Instability of ultrathin surface oxides on alloys under environmental conditions can limit the opportunities for applications of these systems when the thickness control of the insulating oxide film is crucial for device performance. A procedure is developed to directly deposit self-assembled monolayers (SAM) from solvent onto substrates prepared under ultra-high vacuum conditions without exposure to air. As an example, rhenium photosensitizers functionalized with carboxyl linker groups are attached to ultrathin alumina grown on NiAl(1 1 0). The thickness change of the oxide layer during the SAM deposition is quantified by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and can be drastically reduced to one atomic layer. The SAM acts as a capping layer, stabilizing the oxide thin film under environmental conditions. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy elucidates the band alignment in the resulting heterostructure. The method for molecule attachment presented in this manuscript can be extended to a broad class of molecules vulnerable to pyrolysis upon evaporation and presents an elegant method for attaching molecular layers on solid substrates that are sensitive to air.",3
Metamagnetic transition and observation of spin-fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic Heusler compound Pd2MnIn.,"We report detailed investigations on the structural, magnetic, magneto-transport and calorimetric aspects of a partially ordered Heusler compound Pd2MnIn. The sample shows antiferomagnetic (AFM) state below around 120 K, though positive paramagnetic Curie temperature signifies a complex magnetic ground state with the presence of both ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM correlations. A clear spin-flop type metamagnetic transition is observed as evident from the magnetization and resistivity data. However, non-saturation of magnetization even at 145 kOe of applied field implies that the high field state may be a spin canted state, originating from the enhanced FM correlations by field induced conduction electron spin polarization. The sample shows a profound quadratic temperature dependence of resistivity below about 20-25 K indicating a spin-fluctuation dominated low temperature region. Previous electronic structure calculations show the existence of a subtle balance between superexchange mediated AFM state and an RKKY (Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida) interaction mediated FM state in Pd2MnIn. Such competing AFM-FM correlations can be accounted for the observed spin fluctuations.",3
Analysis of optical data using extended Drude model and generalized Allen's formulas.,"Extended Drude model formalism has been successfully utilized for analyzing optical spectra of strongly correlated electron systems including heavy-fermion systems and high-T c superconducting iron pnictides and cuprates. Furthermore, generalized Allen's formulas have been developed and applied to extract the electron-boson spectral density function from measured optical data of high temperature superconductors including cuprates in various material phases. Here we used a reverse process to obtain various optical quantities starting from two typical electron-boson spectral density model functions for three intriguing (normal, pseudogap, and d-wave superconducting) material phases in cuprates. We also assigned the calculated optical results to designated regions in the phase diagram of hole-doped cuprates and compared them with the corresponding measured optical spectra of Bi2Sr2CaCu2 [Formula: see text] (Bi-2212). This comparison suggested that this way of optical data analysis can be a convincing method to study correlated electrons in the copper oxide superconductors and other superconducting systems as well.",3
Machine learning the many-body localization transition in random spin systems.,"The transition between thermal and many-body localized phases in isolated random spin systems are typically identified by the distribution of nearest level spacings. In this work, by employing machine learning methodology, we show this transition can be learnt through raw energy spectrum without any pre-processing. After achieving so in conventional random spin chain with differentiable level spacing distributions, we further construct novel models with misleading signatures of level spacing, and show machine can defeat the latter when training data is raw energy spectrum. Our work shows the low-level energy spectrum contains more information than level spacings, and can be captured by machine in a direct while efficient way, which makes it a promising new tool for studying a variety of isolated quantum systems.",3
Density functional theory for the crystallization of two-dimensional dipolar colloidal alloys.,"Two-dimensional mixtures of dipolar colloidal particles with different dipole moments exhibit extremely rich self-assembly behaviour and are relevant to a wide range of experimental systems, including charged and super-paramagnetic colloids at liquid interfaces. However, there is a gap in our understanding of the crystallization of these systems because existing theories such as integral equation theory and lattice sum methods can only be used to study the high temperature fluid phase and the zero-temperature crystal phase, respectively. In this paper we bridge this gap by developing a density functional theory (DFT), valid at intermediate temperatures, in order to study the crystallization of one and two-component dipolar colloidal monolayers. The theory employs a series expansion of the excess Helmholtz free energy functional, truncated at second order in the density, and taking as input highly accurate bulk fluid direct correlation functions from simulation. Although truncating the free energy at second order means that we cannot determine the freezing point accurately, our approach allows us to calculate ab initio both the density profiles of the different species and the symmetry of the final crystal structures. Our DFT predicts hexagonal crystal structures for one-component systems, and a variety of superlattice structures for two-component systems, including those with hexagonal and square symmetry, in excellent agreement with known results for these systems. The theory also provides new insights into the structure of two-component systems in the intermediate temperature regime where the small particles remain molten but the large particles are frozen on a regular lattice.",3
Generalization of Laughlin's theory for the fractional quantum Hall effect.,"Motivated by the structure of the quasiparticle wavefunction in the composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional quantum Hall filling factor [Formula: see text] (m odd), I consider a suitable quasiparticle operator in differential form, as a modified form of Laughlin's quasiparticle operator, that reproduces quasiparticle wave function as predicted in the CF theory, without a priori assumption of the presence of CFs. I further consider the conjugate of this operator as quasihole operator for obtaining a novel quasihole wave function for 1/m state. Each of these wave functions is interpreted as expelling an electron into a different Hilbert subspace from the original Hilbert space of the Laughlin condensate while still maintaining its correlation (although changed) with the electrons in the condensate such that the expelled electron behaves as a CF with respect to the electrons in the condensate. With this interpretation, I show that the ground state wavefunctions for general states at filling fractions [Formula: see text], respectively, can be constructed as coherent superposition of n coupled Laughlin condensates and their 'conjugates', formed at different Hilbert subspaces. The corresponding wave functions, specially surprising for [Formula: see text] sequence of states, are identical with those proposed in the theory of noninteracting CFs. The states which were considered as fractional quantum Hall effect of interacting CFs, can also be treated in the same footing as for the prominent sequences of states describing as the coupled condensates among which one is a non-Laughlin condensate in a different Hilbert subspace. Further, I predict that the half filling of the lowest Landau level is a quantum critical point for phase transition between two topologically distinct phases each corresponding to a family of states: one consists of large number of coupled Laughlin condensates of filling factor 1/3 and the other corresponds to large number of coupled conjugate Laughlin condensates of filling factor 1, which may be distinguished, respectively, by the absence and presence of upstream edge modes.",3
Time-dependent multiple barriers of the electric and exchange fields in silicene-like nanoribbons.,"We study the transport properties of the silicene nanoribbons subject to periodically driving electric and exchange fields. The multiple barriers made up of corresponding fields reshape the DC conductance by imposing pronounced both Fabry-Perot- and Fano-type resonances accompanied with high spin polarizations. In particular, a transport gap can be generated by the electric barriers with an appropriate strength, which is absent in the case of the barriers of the exchange field. The effects of the hybrid barriers including both electric and exchange fields, however, are not simply a mixture of two individual barriers, while depend on the relative phase of the time-varied barriers. In contrast to static barriers, the further studies of the driving frequency indicate that the in-gap states can survive in the transport gap for electric barriers as the frequency increases. This feature is particularly valuable for building spin-filter or spin-switcher devices.",3
Simple probability distributions on a Fock-space lattice.,"We consider some aspects of a standard model employed in studies of many-body localization: interacting spinless fermions with quenched disorder, for non-zero filling fraction, here on d-dimensional hypercubic lattices. The model may be recast as an equivalent tight-binding model on a 'Fock-space (FS) lattice' with an extensive local connectivity. In the thermodynamic limit exact results are obtained for the distributions of local FS coordination numbers, FS site-energies, and the density of many-body states. All such distributions are well captured by exact diagonalisation on the modest system sizes amenable to numerics. Care is however required in choosing the appropriate variance for the eigenvalue distribution, which has implications for reliable identification of mobility edges.",3
Interaction between in-gap states and carriers at the conductive interface between perovskite oxides.,"The 2D electron systems of SrTiO3/NdGaO3 (STO/NGO) and amorphous-LaAlO3/SrTiO3/NdGaO3 (a-LAO/STO/NGO) heterojunctions were explored. An obvious interaction between in-gap states (IGSs) and carriers was found. The IGSs can trap a large number of carriers and enhance carrier scattering. As a result of the high density of IGSs in STO, the conductivity of STO/NGO was severely weakened. However, for a-LAO/STO/NGO heterojunctions, the high carrier density can reduce the effect of IGSs through the electrostatic screening effect. The competition between IGSs and the screening effect of carriers results in an insulator-metal transition and a strange temperature dependence of carrier density. We also explored the interaction between IGSs and carriers theoretically. A mathematical description was proposed and the calculated results showed good agreement with experimental findings.",3
Strain-induced effects in zigzag-edged blue phosphorene nanoribbons with edge sulfur passivation.,"Motivated by the recent successful growth of quasi-free-standing single layer blue phosphorus (BlueP) on tellurium functionalized Au(1 1 1) by using black phosphorus as the precursor (Zhang et al 2016 Nano Lett. 16 4903; Gu et al 2017 ACS Nano 11 4943), here we study the strain performance for zigzag BlueP nanoribbons (zBluePNRs) with different edge chemical modifications. Based on the first-principles calculations, interestingly, we find that a narrow zBluePNR of width up to approximately 2 nm with edge sulfur (S) passivation under an uniaxial strain exhibits an important effect of negative Poisson's ratio because of the particularity of the P-S bonds at edges, and as the ribbon width further increases the Poisson's ratio varies from negative to positive. Meanwhile, the S-passivation also induces magnetism, and applying a strong enough strain can transfer this zBluePNR from magnetic metal state to half-metal one. All these physical properties are discussed in connection with the variation of microstructure of the ribbons. Our findings may paving the way for both a fundamental understanding of nanoscale physics and applied device engineering.",3
Geometric constraints during epithelial jamming.,"As an injury heals, an embryo develops, or a carcinoma spreads, epithelial cells systematically change their shape. In each of these processes cell shape is studied extensively whereas variability of shape from cell-to-cell is regarded most often as biological noise. But where do cell shape and its variability come from? Here we report that cell shape and shape variability are mutually constrained through a relationship that is purely geometrical. That relationship is shown to govern processes as diverse as maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial epithelial layer cultured from non-asthmatic or asthmatic donors, and formation of the ventral furrow in the Drosophila embryo. Across these and other epithelial systems, shape variability collapses to a family of distributions that is common to all. That distribution, in turn, is accounted for by a mechanistic theory of cell-cell interaction showing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable as the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings suggest a connection between jamming and geometry that spans living organisms and inert jammed systems, and thus transcends system details. Although molecular events are needed for any complete theory of cell shape and cell packing, observations point to the hypothesis that jamming behavior at larger scales of organization sets overriding geometrical constraints.",3
Spin excitation spectrum of high-temperature cuprate superconductors from finite cluster simulations.,"A cluster of spins 1/2 of a finite size can be regarded as a basic building block of a spin texture in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. If this texture has the character of a network of weakly coupled spin clusters, then spin excitation spectra of finite clusters are expected to capture the principal features of the experimental spin response. We calculate spin excitation spectra of several clusters of spins 1/2 coupled by Heisenberg interaction. We find that the calculated spectra exhibit a high degree of variability representative of the actual phenomenology of cuprates, while, at the same time, reproducing a number of important features of the experimentally measured spin response. Among such features are the spin gap, the broad peak around [Formula: see text] approximately (40-70) meV and the sharp peak at zero frequency. The latter feature emerges due to transitions inside the ground-state multiplet of the so-called 'uncompensated' clusters with an odd number of spins.",3
Finsler geometry modeling and Monte Carlo study of liquid crystal elastomers under electric fields.,"The shape transformation of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) under external electric fields is studied through Monte Carlo simulations of models constructed on the basis of Finsler geometry (FG). For polydomain side-chain-type LCEs, it is well known that the external-field-driven alignment of the director is accompanied by an anisotropic shape deformation. However, the mechanism of this deformation is quantitatively still unclear in some part and should be studied further from the microscopic perspective. In this paper, we evaluate whether this shape deformation is successfully simulated, or in other words, quantitatively understood, by the FG model. The FG assumed inside the material is closely connected to the directional degrees of freedom of LC molecules and plays an essential role in the anisotropic transformation. We find that the existing experimental data on the deformations of polydomain LCEs are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo results. It is also found that experimental diagrams of strain versus external voltage of a monodomain LCE in the nematic phase are well described by the FG model.",3
Detection and tracking of anisotropic core-shell colloids.,"Optical microscopy techniques with three dimensional (3D) resolution are powerful tools for the real-space imaging of the structure and dynamics of colloidal systems. While real-space imaging of spherical particles is well established, the observation of shape anisotropic particles has only recently met a lot of interest. Apart from translation, shape anisotropic particles also possess additional rotational degrees of freedom. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel technique to find the position and the orientation of anisotropic particles in 3D. It is based on an algorithm which is applicable to core-shell particles consisting of a spherical core and a shell with arbitrary shape. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm using PMMA/PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) core-shell ellipsoids. The algorithm is tested on artificial images and on experimental data. The correct identification of particle positions with subpixel accuracy and of their orientations with high angular precision in dilute and dense systems is shown. In addition, we developed an advanced particle tracking algorithm that takes both translational and rotational movements of the anisotropic particles into account. We show that our 3D detection and tracking technique is suitable for the accurate and reliable detection of large and dense colloidal systems containing several thousands of particles.",3
A spin dephasing mechanism mediated by the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the asymmetrical confining potential in a semiconductor quantum dot.,"Understanding the spin dephasing mechanism is of fundamental importance in all potential applications of the spin qubit. Here we demonstrate a spin dephasing mechanism in a semiconductor quantum dot due to the 1/f charge noise. The spin-charge interaction is mediated by the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the asymmetrical quantum dot confining potential. The dephasing rate is proportional to both the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the degree of the asymmetry of the confining potential. For parameters typical of the InSb, InAs, and GaAs quantum dots with a moderate well-height [Formula: see text] meV, we find the spin dephasing times are [Formula: see text] mus, 275 mus, and 55 ms, respectively. In particular, the spin dephasing can be enhanced by lowering the well-height. When the well-height is as small as [Formula: see text] meV, the spin depahsing times in the InSb, InAs, and GaAs quantum dots are decreased to [Formula: see text] mus, 18 mus, and 9 ms, respectively.",3
Self-assembling structural colour in nature.,"The diversity and vividness of structural colour in the natural world have been recognised as far back as William Hooke in the 17th century. Whilst it is only recently that advances in the field have revealed the elegance and finesse of the physics used to create these effects. In this topical review we will highlight some of the structures and effects responsible for colour in butterfly scales, bird feathers, plants, insects and beetle elytra that have been studied to date. We will discuss the structures responsible and look at similarities and differences in these structures between species. This will be alongside our current understanding of how these are created biologically, how they develop structurally and what control mechanisms nature has at its disposal to control structure formation.",3
Topological phases in nodeless tetragonal superconductors.,"We compute the topological phase diagram of 2D tetragonal superconductors for the only possible nodeless pairing channels compatible with that crystal symmetry. Subject to a Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that these superconductors show surprising topological features: non-trivial high Chern numbers, massive edge states, and zero-energy modes out of high symmetry points, even though the edge states remain topologically protected. Interestingly, one of these pairing symmetries, [Formula: see text], has been proposed to describe materials such as water-intercalated sodium cobaltates, bilayer silicene or highly doped monolayer graphene, which opens the way for further applications of our results.",3
A unified and efficient theory for the structural properties of actinides and phases of plutonium.,"We show that a calculation using density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) supplemented by an explicit Coulomb interaction term between correlated electrons (GGA+U), can accurately describe structural properties of (1) the room temperature phases of U, Np, Pu, Am and Cm, and (2) the alpha, beta, gamma, delta and phases of plutonium, as does the combination of GGA with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). It thus changes the view on the role of electronic interaction in these systems and opens the way to fast calculations of structural properties in actinides metallic system. We use ab initio values of effective Coulomb interactions and underline that Hund's exchange and spin-orbit coupling are of utmost importance in these calculations. Secondly, we show that phonons properties in delta plutonium are impacted by strong interactions. The GGA+DMFT results exhibits a lattice instability for the transverse (1 1 1) phonon mode. Moreover the amplitude of this lattice instability is consistent with the experimental temperature of stability of this phase. Our calculation thus shows that when the delta phase is thermodynamically unstable (at 0 K), it is also dynamically unstable.",3
Electronic correlations in cerium's high-pressure phases.,"Under high pressure, cerium exhibits three distinct phases, namely [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and -cerium. It is unclear whether the 4f electronic correlations will play a vital role in these phases or not. By utilizing the combination of traditional density functional theory and single-site dynamical mean-field theory, we tried to calculate the electronic structures of cerium's high-pressure phases. Their momentum-resolved spectral functions, total and 4f partial density of states, local self-energy functions, and 4f electronic configurations were exhaustively studied. The calculated results show that the correlated 4f bands strongly hybridize with the conducting spd bands around the Fermi level. The Matsubara self-energy functions exhibit Fermi-liquid like characteristic in the low-frequency regime. In addition, the fluctuations among the 4f atomic eigenstates are somewhat prominent (especially for the phase), which lead to slight modification of the 4f occupancy. It is suggested that the 4f electrons in these phases tend to be itinerant.",3
Observation of intrinsic dark exciton in Janus-MoSSe heterosturcture induced by intrinsic electric field.,"The nature of exciton in heterostructure exhibits distinct properties, which makes heterostructure a promising candidate for valleytronic and optoelectronic applications. Therefore, understanding of exciton behaviour in heterostructure is the key approach to design novel devices. Here, we investigate the electronic properties including quasiparticle-energy calculations (on the level of the GW approximation) and optical properties (on the level of the Bethe-Salpeter equation) of Janus-MoSSe based heterostructure. Our results show that the build-in electric field caused by spontaneous polarization of Janus-MoSSe monolayer can significantly affect the interlayer interactions within the heterostructure, giving rise to a bright-to-dark exciton transition. To shed light on this phenomenon, a theoretical model is developed, which illustrates that the dark exciton can be ascribed to a coherence cancellation at the band edge positions induced by the strong interlayer coupling. Our findings may provide a new way for modulating and developing of van der Waals heterostructure that have applications in valleytronic and optoelectronic devices.",3
Phagraphene nanoribbons: half-metallicity and magnetic phase transition by functional groups and electric field.,"Magnetic nanomaterials with the desirable nature are the basis for developing future spintronic devices, and research for them is of fundamental interest. Here, we explore the realization of half-metallicity and magnetic phase transition for phagraphene nanoribbons in virtue of functional groups (OH and CN) with different coverage fractions and external electric fields. The first-principles calculations show that a single-edge CN functionalization only makes a intrinsic spin-degenerate semiconducting ribbon converted to a quasi-metal or metal, while a single-edge OH modification leads to an occurrence of the half-semiconducting nature regardless of the coverage fraction of groups. Interestingly, the half-metal behavior for the CN and OH double-edge modified ribbons can be achieved either in the zero-electric-field intrinsic state for most of functionalized systems or at a very low electric field, 0.1 V A(-1). More importantly, the observed critical electric field for the transition from ferromagnetic to nonmagnetic phase is lowered significantly almost for all systems, this benefits to design a low electric-field-controlling magnetic switch which can reversibly work between both magnetic and nonmagnetic states. The calculated Gibbs free energy confirms that the group-modified ribbons generally hold a more favorable energy stability in most of the cases, facilitating likely experimental realization.",3
Magnetocrystalline and magnetoelastic constants determined by magnetization dynamics under static strain.,"We consider here the magnetization dynamics induced in a ferromagnet by magnetoelastic coupling, after application of a step like strain. We derive the time evolution of the magnetization vector. We show that the material micromagnetic parameters (and specifically magnetic anisotropy and magnetoelastic coupling) can be derived from measurable quantities, i.e. the precession frequency, relaxation time and phase lag between the precession angles. Such measurements can be performed by state of the art time resolved Kerr experiments.",3
Zitterbewegung near new Dirac points in graphene superlattices.,"New Dirac points may appear when periodic potentials are applied to graphene, and there are many interesting effects near them. Here we investigate the Zitterbewegung effect of fermions described by a Gaussian wave packet in graphene superlattice near these points. The Zitterbewegung near different Dirac points has similar characteristics, while fermions near new ones have different group velocities in both x- and y-direction, which causes the different properties of the Zitterbewegung near them. We also investigate the Zitterbewegung effect influenced by multi Dirac points, and get the evolution with changing potential. Our results suggest that graphene superlattice may provide an appropriate system to study the Zitterbewegung effect near new Dirac points experimentally.",3
Newton's second law in spin-orbit torque.,"Spin-orbit torque (SOT) refers to the excitation of magnetization dynamics via spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the application of a charged current. In this work, we introduce a simple and intuitive description of the SOT in terms of spin force. In Rashba SOC system, the damping-like SOT can be expressed as [Formula: see text], in analogy to the classical torque-force relation, where R c is the effective radius characterizing the Rashba splitting in the momentum space. As a consequence, the magnetic energy is transferred to the conduction electrons, which dissipates through Joule heating at a rate of [Formula: see text], with j e being the applied current. Finally, we propose an experimental verification of our findings via measurement of the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect.",3
Properties of homo- and hetero-Schottky junctions from first principle calculations.,"Electronic structure calculations for a homo-material semimetal (thick Sn)/semiconductor (thin Sn) heterodimensional junction and two conventional metal (Ag or Pt)/silicon hetero-material junctions are performed. Charge distributions and local density of states are examined to compare the physics of junctions formed by quantum confinement in a homo-material, heterodimensional semimetal junction with that of conventional Schottky hetero-material junctions. Relative contributions to the Schottky barrier heights are described in terms of the interface dipoles arising due to charge transfer at the interface and the effects of metal induced gap states extending into the semiconducting regions. Although the importance of these physical mechanisms vary for the three junctions, a single framework describing the junction energetics captures the behaviors of both the heterodimensional semimetal junction and the more conventional metal/semiconductor junctions.",3
Numerical analysis of the notional area in cold field electron emission from arrays.,"The notional area of field emission is an important parameter to correlate characteristic current density to the emission current, linking field emission theories to experimental observations. Recently, it has been reported that the notional area of emission contributes to the high brightness of large diameter emitters. Thus, it is necessary to understand how the notional area of emission depends on physical and geometrical parameters. In this work, we carried out numerical simulations to evaluate the notional area, A n, considering cold field electron emission from a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) emitter in an array. An HCP is suitable to model classically carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibres-like emitters. We provide the dependence of A n on a wide range of physical and geometrical parameters, namely: the separation between the HCP emitters, the aspect ratio, radius, local work function and the macroscopic emission current. We explain the behavior of A n as a function of these parameters and show in which cases A n can be considered nearly constant. Our numerical results are within the framework of the standard Fowler-Nordheim (FN) theory and can simplify the modeling of the field emission phenomenon, because it directly relates simulation predictions to the currents observable experimentally. Also, this work provides information for experimentalists that can be useful to check the validity of the Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier upon the elementary FN theory.",3
Thermal neutron scattering cross sections of (238)U and (235)U in the gamma phase.,"The development of metallic, low-enrichment uranium fuels requires accurate prediction of their neutron transport properties and reactivity parameters, which in turn require thermal neutron scattering data. Accurate prediction of thermal neutron scattering data, including thermal cross sections, requires knowledge of the phonon scattering properties of the medium, but such matrix binding effects in next-generation fuels such as U-Mo, U-Zr, and U-Si are typically neglected because these effects are often difficult to measure or calculate. Using molecular dynamics simulations with previously published interatomic potentials, we calculate the phonon dispersion relations and phonon densities of states for (235)U and (238)U in the alpha and gamma phases. The performance of these potentials was evaluated using published ab initio simulation data and inelastic neutron scattering data. The phonon densities of states obtained by each potential were then utilized to calculate the thermal neutron scattering cross sections of (235)U and (238)U at 1113 K using the NJOY program. The resulting thermal neutron scattering cross sections are assessed by comparison to data obtained from available experimental densities of states. The cross sections generated show how the addition of binding effects decreases the cross section by up to a factor of six over the free-atom model. A definite effect on reactivity is also demonstrated by the use of these thermal libraries on a simple core model. As a consequence, the cross sections generated in this work provide a better description of the true cross section than the free-atom data currently available. We also discuss the sensitivity of the thermal scattering cross sections to the phonon density of states.",3
Screening mixing GW/Bethe-Salpeter approach for triplet states of organic molecules.,"We recently proposed a screening mixing many-body ansatz (Ziaei and Bredow 2017 Phys. Rev. B 96 195115) to decrease the typical overestimation of the Hartree-Fock based GW/Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) singlet-singlet excitation energies in molecular systems. Now we have evaluated the accuracy of the proposed scheme for triplet states of a set of 20 organic molecules known as the Thiel set. We show that by mixing different screenings into GW and BSE calculated within random phase approximation (in order to ensure best gap and an optimal exciton binding energy), the total mean absolute error of 0.59 eV in the standard Hartree-Fock based eigenvalue GW/BSE approach is reduced to 0.26 eV for 63 triplet states. We further demonstrate that the quasi-particle self-consistent GW/BSE approach in which orbitals and energies are updated in the Green's function and the dynamically screened interaction mostly and considerably underestimates the excitation energies as shown for a few molecules.",3
Heisenberg-Ising delta-chain with bond alternation.,The spin-[Formula: see text] delta-chain (sawtooth chain) with antiferromagnetic Heisenberg basal chain and Ising apical-basal interactions is studied. The basal-apical interactions involve the bond alternation. The limiting cases of the model include the symmetrical delta-chain and the antiferromagnetic chain in the staggered magnetic field. We study ground state properties of the model by the exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. The ground state phase diagram as a function of the bond alternation consists of magnetic and various non-magnetic phases. All phases excluding the ferrimagnetic phase are gapped and an origin of the gaps is cleared.,3
Magneto-elastic switching of magnetostrictive nanomagnets with in-plane anisotropy: the effect of material defects.,"We theoretically study the effect of a material defect (material void) on switching errors associated with magneto-elastic switching of magnetization in elliptical magnetostrictive nanomagnets having in-plane magnetic anisotropy. We find that the error probability increases significantly in the presence of the defect, indicating that magneto-elastic switching is particularly vulnerable to material imperfections. Curiously, there is a critical stress value that gives the lowest error probability in both defect-free and defective nanomagnets. The critical stress is much higher in defective nanomagnets than in defect-free ones. Since it is more difficult to generate the critical stress in small nanomagnets than in large nanomagnets (having the same energy barrier for thermal stability), it would be a challenge to downscale magneto-elastically switched nanomagnets in memory and other applications where reliable switching is required. This is likely to be further exacerbated by the presence of defects.",3
Manifestation of topological transitions in a multi-terminal Josephson junction.,"We study nonequilibrium (NE) transport in four-terminal (three-terminal) topological superconductor (SC)-quantum dot (QD) topological superconductor junctions, where the QD is connected via tunneling barriers to the two TS leads and two (one) normal leads (N), respectively. For the four-terminal junction, we find that when increasing the Zeeman field from 0 to a critical value, the supercurrent profile evolves from a typical s-wave pattern to a pure p-wave pattern. In addition, by analyzing the zero-phase difference supercurrent as a function of voltage [Formula: see text] applied to the normal leads and the Zeeman field h applied to the SC, the low-momentum gap [Formula: see text] can be inferred by utilizing the fact that the emergence of a tunneling-induced current should be satisfied under the condition [Formula: see text]. For the three-terminal junction, the NE supercurrent can reveal the quasi-Andreev bound state by exploiting the Andreev reflection process-induced current occurring between the N and SC. Our findings provide an arguably easier route for manifesting the topological phase transition by observing the gap collapse and then reopening as the Zeeman field increases through multi-terminal NE transport.",3
A model of defect cluster creation in fragmented cascades in metals based on morphological analysis.,"The impacts of ions and neutrons in metals cause cascades of atomic collisions that expand and shrink, leaving microstructure defect debris, i.e. interstitial or vacancy clusters or loops of different sizes. In De Backer et al (2016 Europhys. Lett. 115 26001), we described a method to detect the first morphological transition, i.e. the cascade fragmentation in subcascades, and a model of primary damage combining the binary collision approximation and molecular dynamics (MD). In this paper including W, Fe, Be, Zr and 20 other metals, we demonstrate that the fragmentation energy increases with the atomic number and decreases with the atomic density following a unique power law. Above the fragmentation energy, the cascade morphology can be characterized by the cross pair correlation functions of the multitype point pattern formed by the subcascades. We derive the numbers of pairs of subcascades and observed that they follow broken power laws. The energy where the power law breaks indicates the second morphological transition when cascades are formed by branches decorated by chaplets of small subcascades. The subcascade interaction is introduced in our model of primary damage by adding pairwise terms. Using statistics obtained on hundreds of MD cascades in Fe, we demonstrate that the interaction of subcascades increases the proportion of large clusters in the damage created by high energy cascades. Finally, we predict the primary damage of 500 keV Fe ion in Fe and obtain cluster size distributions when large statistics of MD cascades are not feasible.",3
High-throughput assessment of vacancy formation and surface energies of materials using classical force-fields.,"In this work, we present an open access database for surface and vacancy-formation energies using classical force-fields (FFs). These quantities are essential in understanding diffusion behavior, nanoparticle formation and catalytic activities. FFs are often designed for a specific application, hence, this database allows the user to understand whether a FF is suitable for investigating particular defect and surface-related material properties. The FF results are compared to density functional theory and experimental data whenever applicable for validation. At present, we have 17 506 surface energies and 1000 vacancy formation energies calculation in our database and the database is still growing. All the data generated, and the computational tools used, are shared publicly at the following websites: www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/periodic.html, https://jarvis.nist.gov and https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis. Approximations used during the high-throughput calculations are clearly mentioned. Using some of the example cases, we show how our data can be used to directly compare different FFs for a material and to interpret experimental findings such as using Wulff construction for predicting equilibrium shape of nanoparticles. Similarly, the vacancy formation energies data can be useful in understanding diffusion related properties.",3
Quantum vortex melting and superconductor insulator transition in a 2D Josephson junction array in a perpendicular magnetic field via diffusion Monte Carlo.,"In this study, we simulated a quantum rotor model describing a Josephson junction array (JJA) in the phase representation at zero temperature in a perpendicular magnetic field [Formula: see text] (in units of [Formula: see text]) on a [Formula: see text] square lattice with spacing a for [Formula: see text]. The superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) is tuned by the ratio of charging energy to Josephson coupling, U/J. Abrupt drops in the magnetization values were observed in the bigger lattices at certain values of B and U/J caused by the formation of vortices. Increasing U/J at a fixed B field causes quantum vortex melting. The magnetization drops to zero around [Formula: see text] indicating SIT. For B = 0.1 the SIT occurs without an intermediate vortex state and the magnetization scales as [Formula: see text], whereas for B = 0.4 the scaling is [Formula: see text] during the vortex melting. For B between 0.1 and 0.4 the scaling is not clear. We used the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method with a guiding wavefunction optimized using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. The ground state energy is calculated easily in DMC and its error estimates were generally smaller than [Formula: see text], both with and without the guiding wavefunction. Quantities like magnetization and vorticity that do not commute with the Hamiltonian were calculated using an efficient forward walking algorithm. Their estimates are affected severely in absence of the guiding wavefunction. With the guiding wavefunction, errors for the magnetization were generally less than [Formula: see text] and going up to [Formula: see text] percent around the phase transition from the Meissner to the vortex state, and without the guiding wavefunction errors were generally higher than [Formula: see text] and going up to [Formula: see text] around the critical point.",3
Anomalous conductance quantization in the inter-band gap of a one-dimensional channel.,"We report on a singular departure from the canonical step sequence of quantized conductance in a ballistic, quasi-one-dimensional metallic channel. Ideally in such a structure each sub-band population contributes its conductance quantum independently of the rest. In a picture based exclusively on coherent single-carrier transmission, unitary back-scattering may lower a conductance step below ideal but it is not possible for it to enhance it beyond the ideal conductance quantum. Precisely such an anomalous and robust voltage-dependent enhancement has already been observed over the whole density range between sub-band thresholds (de Picciotto R et al 2004 Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 036805, de Picciotto R et al 2008 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 20 164204), a phenomenon left unexplained till now. We show theoretically that the anomalous enhancement of the ideal conductance is the hallmark of carrier transitions coupling the discrete sub-bands.",3
Dynamics of a single hole in the Heisenberg-Kitaev model: a self-consistent Born approximation study.,"The magnetic properties of 4d and 5d transition-metal insulating compounds with the honeycomb structure are believed to be described by the Heisenberg-Kitaev model, which contains both the isotropic Heisenberg interaction J and anisotropic Kitaev interaction K. In this paper, we study the single-hole propagation of the t-J-K model in various magnetically ordered phases by the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that there are low-energy coherent quasiparticle (QP) excitations in all of these phases which appear firstly around the K point in the first Brillouin zone (BZ), but the bandwidths of these QPs are very small due to the hole-magnon coupling. Interestingly, in the zigzag phase relevant to recent experiments, though the QP weights are largely suppressed in the physical spectra in the first BZ, we find that they recover in the extended BZs. Moreover, our results reveal that the low-energy QP spectra are reduced with the increase of K.",3
Antiferromagnetic successive superexchange interactions underlying ferromagnetic couplings in codoped diluted magnetic semiconductors.,"Our recent works have revealed that the magnetic coupling among the magnetic codopants in diluted magnetic semiconductors and doped transition metal oxides has a strong local feature. This was attributed to successive spin polarizations induced by the codopants to their neighboring anion ligands. In the present work, we analyze and refine the successive spin polarization based magnetic coupling using results of ab initio calculations and assign the magnetic coupling among the magnetic codopants to a combination of superexchange and double-exchange interactions. In particular, it is shown that antiferromagnetic successive superexchange interactions can lead to a ferromagnetic coupling between two magnetic dopants mediated by a suitable codopant with the latter forming a ferromagnetic double exchange coupling with its first nearest neighbor anions which couple it with the magnetic cations. This is exemplified by ab initio results for the magnetic coupling of two Co-dopants in the presence of a mediated Cu codopant in the environment of various hosts, namely ZnO, GaN, GaP, TiO2, CdS and SnO2. Additional results for other codopant pairs in various hosts are also presented.",3
"Confinement effects, surface effects, and transport in Bi and Bi1-x Sb x semiconducting and semimetallic nanowires.","Hicks and Dresselhaus predicted that quantum well and nanowire thermoelectric materials could show a meaningful enhancement of the heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency compared to their bulk counterparts. The unique transport properties of bismuth, specifically the low effective mass, high mobility, and large Bohr radius of its charge carriers, enabled the study of size-quantization effects in Bi nanowires following those theoretical predictions. In this review, the band structure of Bi and Bi1-x Sb x alloys is discussed as a function of their composition, temperature, and size-quantization effects. Further, the theoretical basis of the thermoelectric performance enhancement in Bi nanowires is reviewed and compared to experimental data. Single-wire conductivity and Hall data are reviewed. Finally, several synthesis routes for Bi1-x Sb x nanowire samples are discussed, including liquid pressure impregnation, vapor impregnation, electrochemical deposition and wet chemistry impregnation in a template.",3
Crystal growth and magnetic characterization of HoIr2Si2 (I4/mmm).,"Single crystals of HoIr2Si2 with the body-centered ThCr2Si2-type structure (I4/mmm) were grown by Bridgman method from indium flux. Single crystal structure determination yielded a Si-z position of 0.378(1) in the structure. We excluded the presence of the high temperature phase with the primitive CaBe2Ge2-type structure (P4/nmm) by powder x-ray diffraction. Magnetic measurements on the single crystals yield a Neel temperature of [Formula: see text] K. In the inverse magnetic susceptibility a strong anisotropy with Weiss temperatures [Formula: see text] K and [Formula: see text] K occurs above T N. The effective magnetic moment [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is close to the expected value for a free Ho(3+) ion, [Formula: see text]. The field dependent magnetization shows a step-like behaviour due to crystalline electric field effects. The temperature and field dependence of the magnetization hint to the ordering of the magnetic moments along the c direction below T N.",3
Pressure-induced enhancement in the superconductivity of ZrTe3.,"We report the superconductivity enhancement of ZrTe3 on compression up to 33 GPa. The superconducting transition occurs above 4.1 GPa and the superconducting temperature (T C) increases with pressure in further compression, reaching a maximum of 7.1 K at ~28 GPa. An anomalous change of superconducting temperature is seen in the compression above 21 GPa. No structural phase transition is observed in the whole compression up to 36 GPa, but a subtle change in structural parameter is seen between 17-19 GPa, which seems relevant to the anomalous increase in the superconducting temperature. First-principle calculations reveal that the density of states at the Fermi level increases with pressure, which explains the enhancement of T C in ZrTe3 under compression.",3
Extended stability range of the non-Fermi liquid phase in UCoAl.,"High pressure was used to investigate the stability of the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) state, observed in electrical resistivity of uranium-based band metamagnet UCoAl in a pure form (paramagnet) or with Fe substitution (ferromagnetic ground state), both in a single-crystal form. By combining the pressure variations of magnetization and resitivity in these materials the phase diagram for UCoAl had been constructed. The band metamagnet transforms into the ferromagnetic state as the critical metamagnetic field is reduced to zero by the lattice expansion analogous to the negative pressure. Within the same diagram, the increasing hydrostatic pressure drives the critical metamagnetic field upwards while reducing the magnetization increment at the transition. The NFL state persists to about 4-5 GPa. Although spin fluctuations play an important role in the character of UCoAl, they do not exhibit any criticality in the sense of divergence of parameters describing the resistivity around the Ferro-NFL phase transition, which is of the first order type.",3
Phase diagram for the Harper model of the honeycomb lattice.,"The Harper equation arising out of a tight-binding model of electrons on a honeycomb lattice subject to a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane is studied. Contrasting and complementary approaches involving von Neumann entropy, fidelity, fidelity susceptibility, and multifractal analysis are employed to characterize the phase diagram. Remarkably even in the absence of the quasi-periodic on-site potential term, the Hamiltonian allows for a metal-insulator transition. The phase diagram consists of three phases: two metallic phases and an insulating phase. A variant model where next nearest neighbor hopping is included, exhibits a mobility edge and does not allow for a simple single phase diagram characterizing all the eigenstates.",3
"Ground-state structures, physical properties and phase diagram of carbon-rich nitride C5N.","Using the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, four thermodynamically stable C5N phases ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]-1, [Formula: see text]-2 and C2/m) are uncovered. The structures of the [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]-1 and [Formula: see text]-2 phases possess layered features. The dense C2/m phase with 3D strong covalent bond network is calculated to be superhard with hardness of 75.4 and 83.9 GPa by Chen and Gao models. The electronic properties of the C5N is diverse including conductor ([Formula: see text]), indirect semiconductor ([Formula: see text]-1 and [Formula: see text]-2) and direct semiconductor (C2/m). Pressure-induced phase transition sequences and critical pressure points are calculated to be [Formula: see text] --> [Formula: see text]-1 --> [Formula: see text]-2 at 2.7 and 34 GPa, respectively. Though the C2/m phase is metastable at zero temperature, our established pressure-temperature phase diagram of C5N shows that the C2/m becomes stable under high temperatures and pressures. The pressure-temperature phase diagram will give theoretical guidance for further experimental synthesis of different C5N phases.",3
Magnetic and energetic properties of transition metal doped alumina.,"A doped non-diamagnetic alumina (Al2O3) would enable the usage of cutting edge technology, such as magnetoforming, to create advanced systems that take advantage of the high chemical and physical resilience of alumina. This study elucidates the magnetic properties of Cr, Fe, Ni, and Cu doped alpha- and vartheta-alumina. Density functional theory was used to predict the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of doped alumina, as well as its stability. The results indicate that the dopant species and coordination environment are the most important factors in determining the spin density distribution and net magnetic moment, which will strongly direct the ability of the doped alumina to couple with an external field. Similar coordination environments in different phases produce similar spin densities and magnetic moments, indicating that the results presented in this work may be generalizable to the other five or more phases of alumina not studied here.",3
Uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure effects in alpha-RuCl3 single crystals via thermal-expansion measurements.,"We present high-resolution thermal-expansion and specific-heat measurements of single crystalline alpha-RuCl3. An extremely hysteretic structural transition expanding over 100 K is observed by thermal-expansion along both crystallographic axes, which we attribute to a change of stacking sequence of the RuCl3 layers. Three magnetic transitions are observed, which we link to the different stacking sequences. Using our data and thermodynamic relations, we derive the uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure derivatives of all three magnetic transitions. Our results demonstrate that magnetic order of the major transition at approximately 7 K should be totally suppressed by very moderate pressures of 0.3 GPa. Finally, we discuss why our results differ from recent hydrostatic pressure measurements and suggest a possible route to reaching the spin-liquid state in alpha-RuCl3.",3
Confined states in graphene quantum blisters.,"Bilayer graphene samples may exhibit regions where the two layers are locally delaminated forming a so-called quantum blister in the graphene sheet. Electron and hole states can be confined in this graphene quantum blisters (GQB) by applying a global electrostatic bias. We scrutinize the electronic properties of these confined states under the variation of interlayer bias, coupling, and blister's size. The spectra display strong anti-crossings due to the coupling of the confined states on upper and lower layers inside the blister. These spectra are layer localized where the respective confined states reside on either layer or equally distributed. For finite angular momentum, this layer localization can be at the edge of the blister and corresponds to degenerate modes of opposite momenta. Furthermore, the energy levels in GQB exhibit electron-hole symmetry that is sensitive to the electrostatic bias. Finally, we demonstrate that confinement in GQB persists even in the presence of a variation in the inter-layer coupling.",3
A New Result on $H_{\infty }$ State Estimation of Delayed Static Neural Networks.,"This brief presents a new guaranteed performance state estimation criterion for delayed static neural networks. To facilitate the use of the slope information about activation function, the estimation error of activation function is separated into two parts for the first time. Then, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed, which has fully captured the slope information of the activation. Based on the new LKF, a less conservative design criterion of estimator is derived to ensure the asymptotic stability of estimation error system with performance. The desired estimator gain matrices and the performance index are obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method has much better performance than the most recent results.",4
Quantized Synchronization of Chaotic Neural Networks With Scheduled Output Feedback Control.,"In this paper, the synchronization problem of master-slave chaotic neural networks with remote sensors, quantization process, and communication time delays is investigated. The information communication channel between the master chaotic neural network and slave chaotic neural network consists of several remote sensors, with each sensor able to access only partial knowledge of output information of the master neural network. At each sampling instants, each sensor updates its own measurement and only one sensor is scheduled to transmit its latest information to the controller's side in order to update the control inputs for the slave neural network. Thus, such communication process and control strategy are much more energy-saving comparing with the traditional point-to-point scheme. Sufficient conditions for output feedback control gain matrix, allowable length of sampling intervals, and upper bound of network-induced delays are derived to ensure the quantized synchronization of master-slave chaotic neural networks. Lastly, Chua's circuit system and 4-D Hopfield neural network are simulated to validate the effectiveness of the main results.In this paper, the synchronization problem of master-slave chaotic neural networks with remote sensors, quantization process, and communication time delays is investigated.

A Fast and Efficient Method for Training Categorical Radial Basis Function Networks.,"This brief presents a novel learning scheme for categorical data based on radial basis function (RBF) networks. The proposed approach replaces the numerical vectors known as RBF centers with categorical tuple centers, and employs specially designed measures for calculating the distance between the center and the input tuples. Furthermore, a fast noniterative categorical clustering algorithm is proposed to accomplish the first stage of RBF training involving categorical center selection, whereas the weights are calculated through linear regression. The method is applied on 22 categorical data sets and compared with several different learning schemes, including neural networks, support vector machines, naive Bayes classifier, and decision trees. Results show that the proposed method is very competitive, outperforming its rivals in terms of predictive capabilities in the majority of the tested cases.",4
Efficient Exact Inference With Loss Augmented Objective in Structured Learning.,"Structural support vector machine (SVM) is an elegant approach for building complex and accurate models with structured outputs. However, its applicability relies on the availability of efficient inference algorithms--the state-of-the-art training algorithms repeatedly perform inference to compute a subgradient or to find the most violating configuration. In this paper, we propose an exact inference algorithm for maximizing nondecomposable objectives due to special type of a high-order potential having a decomposable internal structure. As an important application, our method covers the loss augmented inference, which enables the slack and margin scaling formulations of structural SVM with a variety of dissimilarity measures, e.g., Hamming loss, precision and recall, Fbeta-loss, intersection over union, and many other functions that can be efficiently computed from the contingency table. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in natural language parsing and sequence segmentation applications.",4
Global Sensitivity Estimates for Neural Network Classifiers.,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have traditionally been seen as black-box models, because, although they are able to find ``hidden'' relations between inputs and outputs with a high approximation capacity, their structure seldom provides any insights on the structure of the functions being approximated. Several research papers have tried to debunk the black-box nature of ANNs, since it limits the potential use of ANNs in many research areas. This paper is framed in this context and proposes a methodology to determine the individual and collective effects of the input variables on the outputs for classification problems based on the ANOVA-functional decomposition. The method is applied after the training phase of the ANN and allows researchers to rank the input variables according to their importance in the variance of the ANN output. The computation of the sensitivity indices for product unit neural networks is straightforward as those indices can be calculated analytically by evaluating the integrals in the ANOVA decomposition. Unfortunately, the sensitivity indices associated with ANNs based on sigmoidal basis functions or radial basis functions cannot be calculated analytically. In this paper, the indices for those kinds of ANNs are proposed to be estimated by the (quasi-) Monte Carlo method.",4
Dealing With the Issues Crucially Related to the Functionality and Reliability of NN-Associated Control for Nonlinear Uncertain Systems.,"The ""universal"" approximating/learning feature of neural network (NN), widely and extensively used for control design, is contingent upon some critical conditions, either of which, if not satisfied, would render such feature vanished. In this paper, we show that these conditions are literally linked with several fundamental issues that have been overlooked in most existing NN-based control designs, either unconsciously or deliberately. We further propose a collective approach to explicitly address these issues, establishing a strategy enabling the NN unit to be fully functional in the control loop during the entire process of system operation and ensuring the more reliable and more effective NN-associated control performance. This is achieved by incorporating the control with a new structural NN unit, consisting of a group of diversified neurons with self-adjusting subneurons, each being driven/stimulated by input signals confined within a compact set. Meanwhile, the continuity of the control signal and the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals are ensured.

Finite-Time Stabilization and Adaptive Control of Memristor-Based Delayed Neural Networks.,"Finite-time stability problem has been a hot topic in control and system engineering. This paper deals with the finite-time stabilization issue of memristor-based delayed neural networks (MDNNs) via two control approaches. First, in order to realize the stabilization of MDNNs in finite time, a delayed state feedback controller is proposed. Then, a novel adaptive strategy is applied to the delayed controller, and finite-time stabilization of MDNNs can also be achieved by using the adaptive control law. Some easily verified algebraic criteria are derived to ensure the stabilization of MDNNs in finite time, and the estimation of the settling time functional is given. Moreover, several finite-time stability results as our special cases for both memristor-based neural networks (MNNs) without delays and neural networks are given.

A Neurodynamic Optimization Approach to Bilevel Quadratic Programming.,"This paper presents a neurodynamic optimization approach to bilevel quadratic programming (BQP). Based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theorem, the BQP problem is reduced to a one-level mathematical program subject to complementarity constraints (MPCC). It is proved that the global solution of the MPCC is the minimal one of the optimal solutions to multiple convex optimization subproblems. A recurrent neural network is developed for solving these convex optimization subproblems. From any initial state, the state of the proposed neural network is convergent to an equilibrium point of the neural network, which is just the optimal solution of the convex optimization subproblem. Compared with existing recurrent neural networks for BQP, the proposed neural network is guaranteed for delivering the exact optimal solutions to any convex BQP problems. Moreover, it is proved that the proposed neural network for bilevel linear programming is convergent to an equilibrium point in finite time. Finally, three numerical examples are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",4
A Unified Fisher's Ratio Learning Method for Spatial Filter Optimization.,"To detect the mental task of interest, spatial filtering has been widely used to enhance the spatial resolution of electroencephalography (EEG). However, the effectiveness of spatial filtering is undermined due to the significant nonstationarity of EEG. Based on regularization, most of the conventional stationary spatial filter design methods address the nonstationarity at the cost of the interclass discrimination. Moreover, spatial filter optimization is inconsistent with feature extraction when EEG covariance matrices could not be jointly diagonalized due to the regularization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for a spatial filter design. With Fisher's ratio in feature space directly used as the objective function, the spatial filter optimization is unified with feature extraction. Given its ratio form, the selection of the regularization parameter could be avoided. We evaluate the proposed method on a binary motor imagery data set of 16 subjects, who performed the calibration and test sessions on different days. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields improvement in classification performance for both single broadband and filter bank settings compared with conventional nonunified methods. We also provide a systematic attempt to compare different objective functions in modeling data nonstationarity with simulation studies.To detect the mental task of interest, spatial filtering has been widely used to enhance the spatial resolution of electroencephalography (EEG).

A New Discrete-Time Multi-Constrained $K$-Winner-Take-All Recurrent Network and Its Application to Prioritized Scheduling.,"In this paper, we propose a novel discrete-time recurrent neural network aiming to resolve a new class of multi-constrained K-winner-take-all (K-WTA) problems. By facilitating specially designed asymmetric neuron weights, the proposed model is capable of operating in a fully parallel manner, thereby allowing true digital implementation. This paper also provides theorems that delineate the theoretical upper bound of the convergence latency, which is merely O(K). Importantly, via simulations, the average convergence time is close to O(1) in most general cases. Moreover, as the multi-constrained K-WTA problem degenerates to a traditional single-constrained problem, the upper bound becomes exactly two parallel iterations, which significantly outperforms the existing K-WTA models. By associating the neurons and neuron weights with routing paths and path priorities, respectively, we then apply the model to a prioritized flow scheduler for the data center networks. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheduler converges to the equilibrium state within near-constant time for different scales of networks while achieving maximal throughput, quality-of-service priority differentiation, and minimum energy consumption, subject to the flow contention-free constraints.",4
Regularized Class-Specific Subspace Classifier.,"In this paper, we mainly focus on how to achieve the translated subspace representation for each class, which could simultaneously indicate the distribution of the associated class and the differences from its complementary classes. By virtue of the reconstruction problem, the class-specific subspace classifier (CSSC) problem could be represented as a series of biobjective optimization problems, which minimize and maximize the reconstruction errors of the related class and its complementary classes, respectively. Besides, the regularization term is specifically introduced to ensure the whole system's stability. Accordingly, a regularized class-specific subspace classifier (RCSSC) method can be further proposed based on solving a general quadratic ratio problem. The proposed RCSSC method consistently converges to the global optimal subspace and translation under the variations of the regularization parameter. Furthermore, the proposed RCSSC method could be extended to the unregularized case, which is known as unregularized CSSC (UCSSC) method via orthogonal decomposition technique. As a result, the effectiveness and the superiority of both proposed RCSSC and UCSSC methods can be verified analytically and experimentally.In this paper, we mainly focus on how to achieve the translated subspace representation for each class, which could simultaneously indicate the distribution of the associated class and the differences from its complementary classes.

Online Training of an Opto-Electronic Reservoir Computer Applied to Real-Time Channel Equalization.,"Reservoir computing is a bioinspired computing paradigm for processing time-dependent signals. The performance of its analog implementation is comparable to other state-of-the-art algorithms for tasks such as speech recognition or chaotic time series prediction, but these are often constrained by the offline training methods commonly employed. Here, we investigated the online learning approach by training an optoelectronic reservoir computer using a simple gradient descent algorithm, programmed on a field-programmable gate array chip. Our system was applied to wireless communications, a quickly growing domain with an increasing demand for fast analog devices to equalize the nonlinear distorted channels. We report error rates up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous implementations on this task. We show that our system is particularly well suited for realistic channel equalization by testing it on a drifting and a switching channel and obtaining good performances.",4
Consensus of Multiagent Systems With Distance-Dependent Communication Networks.,"In this paper, we study the consensus problem of discrete-time and continuous-time multiagent systems with distance-dependent communication networks, respectively. The communication weight between any two agents is assumed to be a nonincreasing function of their distance. First, we consider the networks with fixed connectivity. In this case, the interaction between adjacent agents always exists but the influence could possibly become negligible if the distance is long enough. We show that consensus can be reached under arbitrary initial states if the decay rate of the communication weight is less than a given bound. Second, we study the networks with distance-dependent connectivity. It is assumed that any two agents interact with each other if and only if their distance does not exceed a fixed range. With the validity of some conditions related to the property of the initial communication graph, we prove that consensus can be achieved asymptotically. Third, we present some applications of the main results to opinion consensus problems and formation control problems. Finally, several simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.In this paper, we study the consensus problem of discrete-time and continuous-time multiagent systems with distance-dependent communication networks, respectively.

Fully Decentralized Semi-supervised Learning via Privacy-preserving Matrix Completion.,"Distributed learning refers to the problem of inferring a function when the training data are distributed among different nodes. While significant work has been done in the contexts of supervised and unsupervised learning, the intermediate case of Semi-supervised learning in the distributed setting has received less attention. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for this class of problems, by extending the framework of manifold regularization. The main component of the proposed algorithm consists of a fully distributed computation of the adjacency matrix of the training patterns. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm for low-rank distributed matrix completion, based on the framework of diffusion adaptation. Overall, the distributed Semi-supervised algorithm is efficient and scalable, and it can preserve privacy by the inclusion of flexible privacy-preserving mechanisms for similarity computation. The experimental results and comparison on a wide range of standard Semi-supervised benchmarks validate our proposal.",4
Event-Triggered Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Continuous-Time Systems With Control Constraints.,"In this paper, an event-triggered near optimal control structure is developed for nonlinear continuous-time systems with control constraints. Due to the saturating actuators, a nonquadratic cost function is introduced and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for constrained nonlinear continuous-time systems is formulated. In order to solve the HJB equation, an actor-critic framework is presented. The critic network is used to approximate the cost function and the action network is used to estimate the optimal control law. In addition, in the proposed method, the control signal is transmitted in an aperiodic manner to reduce the computational and the transmission cost. Both the networks are only updated at the trigger instants decided by the event-triggered condition. Detailed Lyapunov analysis is provided to guarantee that the closed-loop event-triggered system is ultimately bounded. Three case studies are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Spectrum-Diverse Neuroevolution With Unified Neural Models.,"Learning algorithms are being increasingly adopted in various applications. However, further expansion will require methods that work more automatically. To enable this level of automation, a more powerful solution representation is needed. However, by increasing the representation complexity, a second problem arises. The search space becomes huge, and therefore, an associated scalable and efficient searching algorithm is also required. To solve both the problems, first a powerful representation is proposed that unifies most of the neural networks features from the literature into one representation. Second, a new diversity preserving method called spectrum diversity is created based on the new concept of chromosome spectrum that creates a spectrum out of the characteristics and frequency of alleles in a chromosome. The combination of spectrum diversity with a unified neuron representation enables the algorithm to either surpass or equal NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies on all of the five classes of problems tested. Ablation tests justify the good results, showing the importance of added new features in the unified neuron representation. Part of the success is attributed to the novelty-focused evolution and good scalability with a chromosome size provided by spectrum diversity. Thus, this paper sheds light on a new representation and diversity preserving mechanism that should impact algorithms and applications to come.",4
Underdetermined Blind Source Separation Using Sparse Coding.,"In an underdetermined mixture system with unknown sources, it is a challenging task to separate these sources from their observed mixture signals, where . By exploiting the technique of sparse coding, we propose an effective approach to discover some 1-D subspaces from the set consisting of all the time-frequency (TF) representation vectors of observed mixture signals. We show that these 1-D subspaces are associated with TF points where only single source possesses dominant energy. By grouping the vectors in these subspaces via hierarchical clustering algorithm, we obtain the estimation of the mixing matrix. Finally, the source signals could be recovered by solving a series of least squares problems. Since the sparse coding strategy considers the linear representation relations among all the TF representation vectors of mixing signals, the proposed algorithm can provide an accurate estimation of the mixing matrix and is robust to the noises compared with the existing underdetermined blind source separation approaches. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Distributed Finite-Time Cooperative Control of Multiple High-Order Nonholonomic Mobile Robots.,"The consensus problem of multiple nonholonomic mobile robots in the form of high-order chained structure is considered in this paper. Based on the model features and the finite-time control technique, a finite-time cooperative controller is explicitly constructed which guarantees that the states consensus is achieved in a finite time. As an application of the proposed results, finite-time formation control of multiple wheeled mobile robots is studied and a finite-time formation control algorithm is proposed. To show effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation example is given.",4
Assessing Generalization Ability of Majority Vote Point Classifiers.,"Classification algorithms have been traditionally designed to simultaneously reduce errors caused by bias as well by variance. However, there occur many situations where low generalization error becomes extremely crucial to getting tangible classification solutions, and even slight overfitting causes serious consequences in the test results. In such situations, classifiers with low Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension can bring out positive differences due to two main advantages: 1) the classifier manages to keep the test error close to training error and 2) the classifier learns effectively with small number of samples. This paper shows that a class of classifiers named majority vote point (MVP) classifiers, on account of very low VC dimension, can exhibit a generalization error that is even lower than that of linear classifiers. This paper proceeds by theoretically formulating an upper bound on the VC dimension of the MVP classifier. Later, through empirical analysis, the trend of exact values of VC dimension is estimated. Finally, case studies on machine fault diagnosis problems and prostate tumor detection problem revalidate the fact that an MVP classifier can achieve a lower generalization error than most other classifiers.",4
Method for Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters Based on Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.,"It is crucial to determine the optimal number of clusters for the clustering quality in cluster analysis. From the standpoint of sample geometry, two concepts, i.e., the sample clustering dispersion degree and the sample clustering synthesis degree, are defined, and a new clustering validity index is designed. Moreover, a method for determining the optimal number of clusters based on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) algorithm is proposed. The new index and the method can evaluate the clustering results produced by the AHC and determine the optimal number of clusters for multiple types of datasets, such as linear, manifold, annular, and convex structures. Theoretical research and experimental results indicate the validity and good performance of the proposed index and the method.",4
Mesh Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Unsupervised Learning of Features With Structure Preservation on 3-D Meshes.,"Discriminative features of 3-D meshes are significant to many 3-D shape analysis tasks. However, handcrafted descriptors and traditional unsupervised 3-D feature learning methods suffer from several significant weaknesses: 1) the extensive human intervention is involved; 2) the local and global structure information of 3-D meshes cannot be preserved, which is in fact an important source of discriminability; 3) the irregular vertex topology and arbitrary resolution of 3-D meshes do not allow the direct application of the popular deep learning models; 4) the orientation is ambiguous on the mesh surface; and 5) the effect of rigid and nonrigid transformations on 3-D meshes cannot be eliminated. As a remedy, we propose a deep learning model with a novel irregular model structure, called mesh convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines (MCRBMs). MCRBM aims to simultaneously learn structure-preserving local and global features from a novel raw representation, local function energy distribution. In addition, multiple MCRBMs can be stacked into a deeper model, called mesh convolutional deep belief networks (MCDBNs). MCDBN employs a novel local structure preserving convolution (LSPC) strategy to convolve the geometry and the local structure learned by the lower MCRBM to the upper MCRBM. LSPC facilitates resolving the challenging issue of the orientation ambiguity on the mesh surface in MCDBN. Experiments using the proposed MCRBM and MCDBN were conducted on three common aspects: global shape retrieval, partial shape retrieval, and shape correspondence. Results show that the features learned by the proposed methods outperform the other state-of-the-art 3-D shape features.",4
Robust Image Regression Based on the Extended Matrix Variate Power Exponential Distribution of Dependent Noise.,"Dealing with partial occlusion or illumination is one of the most challenging problems in image representation and classification. In this problem, the characterization of the representation error plays a crucial role. In most current approaches, the error matrix needs to be stretched into a vector and each element is assumed to be independently corrupted. This ignores the dependence between the elements of error. In this paper, it is assumed that the error image caused by partial occlusion or illumination changes is a random matrix variate and follows the extended matrix variate power exponential distribution. This has the heavy tailed regions and can be used to describe a matrix pattern of lxm dimensional observations that are not independent. This paper reveals the essence of the proposed distribution: it actually alleviates the correlations between pixels in an error matrix E and makes E approximately Gaussian. On the basis of this distribution, we derive a Schatten p -norm-based matrix regression model with Lq regularization. Alternating direction method of multipliers is applied to solve this model. To get a closed-form solution in each step of the algorithm, two singular value function thresholding operators are introduced. In addition, the extended Schatten p -norm is utilized to characterize the distance between the test samples and classes in the design of the classifier. Extensive experimental results for image reconstruction and classification with structural noise demonstrate that the proposed algorithm works much more robustly than some existing regression-based methods.",4
Neural Approximation-Based Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Nonstrict Feedback Discrete-Time Systems.,"In this paper, an adaptive control approach-based neural approximation is developed for a class of uncertain nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems. The main characteristic of the considered systems is that they can be viewed as a class of multi-input multioutput systems in the nonstrict feedback structure. The similar control problem of this class of systems has been addressed in the past, but it focused on the continuous-time systems. Due to the complicacies of the system structure, it will become more difficult for the controller design and the stability analysis. To stabilize this class of systems, a new recursive procedure is developed, and the effect caused by the noncausal problem in the nonstrict feedback DT structure can be solved using a semirecurrent neural approximation. Based on the Lyapunov difference approach, it is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobal, ultimately uniformly bounded, and a good tracking performance can be guaranteed. The feasibility of the proposed controllers can be validated by setting a simulation example.",4
Observer-Based Adaptive NN Control for a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems With Nonsymmetric Input Saturation.,"This paper is concerned with the problem of adaptive tracking control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with nonsymmetric input saturation and immeasurable states. The radial basis function of neural network (NN) is employed to approximate unknown functions, and an NN state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable states. To analyze the effect of input saturation, an auxiliary system is employed. By the aid of adaptive backstepping technique, an adaptive tracking control approach is developed. Under the proposed adaptive tracking controller, the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system is achieved. Moreover, distinct from most of the existing references, the tracking error can be bounded by an explicit function of design parameters and saturation input error. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Semisupervised Feature Selection Based on Relevance and Redundancy Criteria.,"Feature selection aims to gain relevant features for improved classification performance and remove redundant features for reduced computational cost. How to balance these two factors is a problem especially when the categorical labels are costly to obtain. In this paper, we address this problem using semisupervised learning method and propose a max-relevance and min-redundancy criterion based on Pearson's correlation (RRPC) coefficient. This new method uses the incremental search technique to select optimal feature subsets. The new selected features have strong relevance to the labels in supervised manner, and avoid redundancy to the selected feature subsets under unsupervised constraints. Comparative studies are performed on binary data and multicategory data from benchmark data sets. The results show that the RRPC can achieve a good balance between relevance and redundancy in semisupervised feature selection. We also compare the RRPC with classic supervised feature selection criteria (such as mRMR and Fisher score), unsupervised feature selection criteria (such as Laplacian score), and semisupervised feature selection criteria (such as sSelect and locality sensitive). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",4
Lazy-Learning-Based Data-Driven Model-Free Adaptive Predictive Control for a Class of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems.,"In this paper, a novel data-driven model-free adaptive predictive control method based on lazy learning technique is proposed for a class of discrete-time single-input and single-output nonlinear systems. The feature of the proposed approach is that the controller is designed only using the input-output (I/O) measurement data of the system by means of a novel dynamic linearization technique with a new concept termed pseudogradient (PG). Moreover, the predictive function is implemented in the controller using a lazy-learning (LL)-based PG predictive algorithm, such that the controller not only shows good robustness but also can realize the effect of model-free adaptive prediction for the sudden change of the desired signal. Further, since the LL technique has the characteristic of database queries, both the online and offline I/O measurement data are fully and simultaneously utilized to real-time adjust the controller parameters during the control process. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method is guaranteed by rigorous mathematical analysis. Meanwhile, the numerical simulations and the laboratory experiments implemented on a practical three-tank water level control system both verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",4
Novel Formulation of Adaptive MPC as EKF Using ANN Model: Multiproduct Semibatch Polymerization Reactor Case Study.,"In this paper, a novel formulation for nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) has been proposed incorporating the extended Kalman filter (EKF) control concept using a purely data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) model based on measurements for supervisory control. The proposed scheme consists of two modules focusing on online parameter estimation based on past measurements and control estimation over control horizon based on minimizing the deviation of model output predictions from set points along the prediction horizon. An industrial case study for temperature control of a multiproduct semibatch polymerization reactor posed as a challenge problem has been considered as a test bed to apply the proposed ANN-EKFMPC strategy at supervisory level as a cascade control configuration along with proportional integral controller [ANN-EKFMPC with PI (ANN-EKFMPC-PI)]. The proposed approach is formulated incorporating all aspects of MPC including move suppression factor for control effort minimization and constraint-handling capability including terminal constraints. The nominal stability analysis and offset-free tracking capabilities of the proposed controller are proved. Its performance is evaluated by comparison with a standard MPC-based cascade control approach using the same adaptive ANN model. The ANN-EKFMPC-PI control configuration has shown better controller performance in terms of temperature tracking, smoother input profiles, as well as constraint-handling ability compared with the ANN-MPC with PI approach for two products in summer and winter. The proposed scheme is found to be versatile although it is based on a purely data-driven model with online parameter estimation.",4
Hair Segmentation Using Heuristically-Trained Neural Networks.,"We present a method for binary classification using neural networks (NNs) that performs training and classification on the same data using the help of a pretraining heuristic classifier. The heuristic classifier is initially used to segment data into three clusters of high-confidence positives, high-confidence negatives, and low-confidence sets. The high-confidence sets are used to train an NN, which is then used to classify the low-confidence set. Applying this method to the binary classification of hair versus nonhair patches, we obtain a 2.2% performance increase using the heuristically trained NN over the current state-of-the-art hair segmentation method.",4
Markov Blanket Feature Selection Using Representative Sets.,"It has received much attention in recent years to use Markov blankets in a Bayesian network for feature selection. The Markov blanket of a class attribute in a Bayesian network is a unique yet minimal feature subset for optimal feature selection if the probability distribution of a data set can be faithfully represented by this Bayesian network. However, if a data set violates the faithful condition, Markov blankets of a class attribute may not be unique. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a new concept of representative sets and then design the selection via group alpha-investing (SGAI) algorithm to perform Markov blanket feature selection with representative sets for classification. Using a comprehensive set of real data, our empirical studies have demonstrated that SGAI outperforms the state-of-the-art Markov blanket feature selectors and other well-established feature selection methods.It has received much attention in recent years to use Markov blankets in a Bayesian network for feature selection.

Person Re-identification by Multi-hypergraph Fusion.,"Matching people across nonoverlapping cameras, also known as person re-identification, is an important and challenging research topic. Despite its great demand in many crucial applications such as surveillance, person re-identification is still far from being solved. Due to drastic view changes, even the same person may look quite dissimilar in different cameras. Illumination and pose variations further aggravate this discrepancy. To this end, various feature descriptors have been designed for improving the matching accuracy. Since different features encode information from different aspects, in this paper, we propose to effectively leverage multiple off-the-shelf features via multi-hypergraph fusion. A hypergraph captures not only pairwise but also high-order relationships among the subjects being matched. In addition, different from conventional approaches in which the matching is achieved by computing the pairwise distance or similarity between a probe and a gallery subject, the similarities between the probe and all gallery subjects are learned jointly via hypergraph optimization. Experiments on popular data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and a superior performance is achieved as compared with the most recent state-of-the-arts.Matching people across nonoverlapping cameras, also known as person re-identification, is an important and challenging research topic.

Multicolumn RBF Network.,"This paper proposes the multicolumn RBF network (MCRN) as a method to improve the accuracy and speed of a traditional radial basis function network (RBFN). The RBFN, as a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), suffers from costly kernel inner-product calculations due to the use of many instances as the centers of hidden units. This issue is not critical for small datasets, as adding more hidden units will not burden the computation time. However, for larger datasets, the RBFN requires many hidden units with several kernel computations to generalize the problem. The MCRN mechanism is constructed based on dividing a dataset into smaller subsets using the k-d tree algorithm. resultant subsets are considered as separate training datasets to train individual RBFNs. Those small RBFNs are stacked in parallel and bulged into the MCRN structure during testing. The MCRN is considered as a well-developed and easy-to-use parallel structure, because each individual ANN has been trained on its own subsets and is completely separate from the other ANNs. This parallelized structure reduces the testing time compared with that of a single but larger RBFN, which cannot be easily parallelized due to its fully connected structure. Small informative subsets provide the MCRN with a regional experience to specify the problem instead of generalizing it. The MCRN has been tested on many benchmark datasets and has shown better accuracy and great improvements in training and testing times compared with a single RBFN. The MCRN also shows good results compared with those of some machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors.",4
A Fast Algorithm of Convex Hull Vertices Selection for Online Classification.,"Reducing samples through convex hull vertices selection (CHVS) within each class is an important and effective method for online classification problems, since the classifier can be trained rapidly with the selected samples. However, the process of CHVS is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to select the convex hull vertices, based on the convex hull decomposition and the property of projection. In the proposed algorithm, the quadratic minimization problem of computing the distance between a point and a convex hull is converted into a linear equation problem with a low computational complexity. When the data dimension is high, an approximate, instead of exact, convex hull is allowed to be selected by setting an appropriate termination condition in order to delete more nonimportant samples. In addition, the impact of outliers is also considered, and the proposed algorithm is improved by deleting the outliers in the initial procedure. Furthermore, a dimension convention technique via the kernel trick is used to deal with nonlinearly separable problems. An upper bound is theoretically proved for the difference between the support vector machines based on the approximate convex hull vertices selected and all the training samples. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed algorithm.",4
A Regularized SNPOM for Stable Parameter Estimation of RBF-AR(X) Model.,"Recently, the radial basis function (RBF) network-style coefficients AutoRegressive (with exogenous inputs) [RBF-AR(X)] model identified by the structured nonlinear parameter optimization method (SNPOM) has attracted considerable interest because of its significant performance in nonlinear system modeling. However, this promising technique may occasionally confront the problem that the parameters are divergent in the optimization process, which may be a potential issue ignored by most researchers. In this paper, a regularized SNPOM, together with the regularization parameter detection technique, is presented to estimate the parameters of RBF-AR(X) models. This approach first separates the parameters of an RBF-AR(X) model into a linear parameters set and a nonlinear parameters set, and then combines a gradient-based nonlinear optimization algorithm for estimating the nonlinear parameters and the regularized least squares method for estimating the linear parameters. Several examples demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective to cope with the potential unstable problem in the parameters search process, and may also yield better or similar multistep forecasting accuracy and better robustness than the previous method.",4
Identifying Objective and Subjective Words via Topic Modeling.,"It is observed that distinct words in a given document have either strong or weak ability in delivering facts (i.e., the objective sense) or expressing opinions (i.e., the subjective sense) depending on the topics they associate with. Motivated by the intuitive assumption that different words have varying degree of discriminative power in delivering the objective sense or the subjective sense with respect to their assigned topics, a model named as dentified bjective- ubjective latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) ( osLDA) is proposed in this paper. In the osLDA model, the simple Polya urn model adopted in traditional topic models is modified by incorporating it with a probabilistic generative process, in which the novel ""Bag-of-Discriminative-Words"" (BoDW) representation for the documents is obtained; each document has two different BoDW representations with regard to objective and subjective senses, respectively, which are employed in the joint objective and subjective classification instead of the traditional Bag-of-Topics representation. The experiments reported on documents and images demonstrate that: 1) the BoDW representation is more predictive than the traditional ones; 2) osLDA boosts the performance of topic modeling via the joint discovery of latent topics and the different objective and subjective power hidden in every word; and 3) osLDA has lower computational complexity than supervised LDA, especially under an increasing number of topics.",4
Determination of the Edge of Criticality in Echo State Networks Through Fisher Information Maximization.,"It is a widely accepted fact that the computational capability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is maximized on the so-called ""edge of criticality."" Once the network operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific application both in terms of: 1) low prediction error and 2) high short-term memory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly influenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal, application-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still missing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a theoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for determining the edge of criticality in RNNs. It is proved that Fisher information is maximized for (finite-size) systems operating in such critical regions. However, Fisher information is notoriously difficult to compute and requires the analytic form of the probability density function ruling the system behavior. This paper takes advantage of a recently developed nonparametric estimator of the Fisher information matrix and provides a method to determine the critical region of echo state networks (ESNs), a particular class of recurrent networks. The considered control parameters, which indirectly affect the ESN performance, are explored to identify those configurations lying on the edge of criticality and, as such, maximizing Fisher information and computational performance. Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Cooperative Adaptive Output Regulation for Second-Order Nonlinear Multiagent Systems With Jointly Connected Switching Networks.,"This paper studies the cooperative global robust output regulation problem for a class of heterogeneous second-order nonlinear uncertain multiagent systems with jointly connected switching networks. The main contributions consist of the following three aspects. First, we generalize the result of the adaptive distributed observer from undirected jointly connected switching networks to directed jointly connected switching networks. Second, by performing a new coordinate and input transformation, we convert our problem into the cooperative global robust stabilization problem of a more complex augmented system via the distributed internal model principle. Third, we solve the stabilization problem by a distributed state feedback control law. Our result is illustrated by the leader-following consensus problem for a group of Van der Pol oscillators.",4
Experienced Gray Wolf Optimization Through Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks.,"In this paper, a variant of gray wolf optimization (GWO) that uses reinforcement learning principles combined with neural networks to enhance the performance is proposed. The aim is to overcome, by reinforced learning, the common challenge of setting the right parameters for the algorithm. In GWO, a single parameter is used to control the exploration/exploitation rate, which influences the performance of the algorithm. Rather than using a global way to change this parameter for all the agents, we use reinforcement learning to set it on an individual basis. The adaptation of the exploration rate for each agent depends on the agent's own experience and the current terrain of the search space. In order to achieve this, experience repository is built based on the neural network to map a set of agents' states to a set of corresponding actions that specifically influence the exploration rate. The experience repository is updated by all the search agents to reflect experience and to enhance the future actions continuously. The resulted algorithm is called experienced GWO (EGWO) and its performance is assessed on solving feature selection problems and on finding optimal weights for neural networks algorithm. We use a set of performance indicators to evaluate the efficiency of the method. Results over various data sets demonstrate an advance of the EGWO over the original GWO and over other metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization.",4
Probabilistic Low-Rank Multitask Learning.,"In this paper, we consider the problem of learning multiple related tasks simultaneously with the goal of improving the generalization performance of individual tasks. The key challenge is to effectively exploit the shared information across multiple tasks as well as preserve the discriminative information for each individual task. To address this, we propose a novel probabilistic model for multitask learning (MTL) that can automatically balance between low-rank and sparsity constraints. The former assumes a low-rank structure of the underlying predictive hypothesis space to explicitly capture the relationship of different tasks and the latter learns the incoherent sparse patterns private to each task. We derive and perform inference via variational Bayesian methods. Experimental results on both regression and classification tasks on real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in dealing with the MTL problems.",4
Adaptive Reliable $H_\infty $ Static Output Feedback Control Against Markovian Jumping Sensor Failures.,"This paper investigates the adaptive static output feedback (SOF) control problem for continuous-time linear systems with stochastic sensor failures. A multi-Markovian variable is introduced to denote the failure scaling factors for each sensor. Different from the existing results, the failure parameters are stochastically jumping and their bounds of are unknown. An adaptive reliable SOF control method is proposed, where the controller parameters are updated automatically to compensate for the failure effects on systems. A novel cubic absolute Lyapunov function is proposed to design adaptive laws only using measured output with sensor failures, and the convergence of jumping adaptive parameters is ensured by a trajectory initialization approach. The resultant designs can guarantee the asymptotic stability with an adaptive performance of closed-loop systems regardless of sensor failures. Finally, the simulation results on the ""Raptor-90"" helicopter are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",4
Multiview Boosting With Information Propagation for Classification.,"Multiview learning has shown promising potential in many applications. However, most techniques are focused on either view consistency, or view diversity. In this paper, we introduce a novel multiview boosting algorithm, called Boost.SH, that computes weak classifiers independently of each view but uses a shared weight distribution to propagate information among the multiple views to ensure consistency. To encourage diversity, we introduce randomized Boost.SH and show its convergence to the greedy Boost.SH solution in the sense of minimizing regret using the framework of adversarial multiarmed bandits. We also introduce a variant of Boost.SH that combines decisions from multiple experts for recommending views for classification. We propose an expert strategy for multiview learning based on inverse variance, which explores both consistency and diversity. Experiments on biometric recognition, document categorization, multilingual text, and yeast genomic multiview data sets demonstrate the advantage of Boost.SH (85%) compared with other boosting algorithms like AdaBoost (82%) using concatenated views and substantially better than a multiview kernel learning algorithm (74%).",4
Self-Taught Low-Rank Coding for Visual Learning.,"The lack of labeled data presents a common challenge in many computer vision and machine learning tasks. Semisupervised learning and transfer learning methods have been developed to tackle this challenge by utilizing auxiliary samples from the same domain or from a different domain, respectively. Self-taught learning, which is a special type of transfer learning, has fewer restrictions on the choice of auxiliary data. It has shown promising performance in visual learning. However, existing self-taught learning methods usually ignore the structure information in data. In this paper, we focus on building a self-taught coding framework, which can effectively utilize the rich low-level pattern information abstracted from the auxiliary domain, in order to characterize the high-level structural information in the target domain. By leveraging a high quality dictionary learned across auxiliary and target domains, the proposed approach learns expressive codings for the samples in the target domain. Since many types of visual data have been proven to contain subspace structures, a low-rank constraint is introduced into the coding objective to better characterize the structure of the given target set. The proposed representation learning framework is called self-taught low-rank (S-Low) coding, which can be formulated as a nonconvex rank-minimization and dictionary learning problem. We devise an efficient majorization-minimization augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm to solve it. Based on the proposed S-Low coding mechanism, both unsupervised and supervised visual learning algorithms are derived. Extensive experiments on five benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",4
Fine-Grained Image Classification via Low-Rank Sparse Coding With General and Class-Specific Codebooks.,"This paper tries to separate fine-grained images by jointly learning the encoding parameters and codebooks through low-rank sparse coding (LRSC) with general and class-specific codebook generation. Instead of treating each local feature independently, we encode the local features within a spatial region jointly by LRSC. This ensures that the spatially nearby local features with similar visual characters are encoded by correlated parameters. In this way, we can make the encoded parameters more consistent for fine-grained image representation. Besides, we also learn a general codebook and a number of class-specific codebooks in combination with the encoding scheme. Since images of fine-grained classes are visually similar, the difference is relatively small between the general codebook and each class-specific codebook. We impose sparsity constraints to model this relationship. Moreover, the incoherences with different codebooks and class-specific codebooks are jointly considered. We evaluate the proposed method on several public image data sets. The experimental results show that by learning general and class-specific codebooks with the joint encoding of local features, we are able to model the differences among different fine-grained classes than many other fine-grained image classification methods.",4
Global Asymptotic Stability and Stabilization of Neural Networks With General Noise.,"Neural networks (NNs) in the stochastic environment were widely modeled as stochastic differential equations, which were driven by white noise, such as Brown or Wiener process in the existing papers. However, they are not necessarily the best models to describe dynamic characters of NNs disturbed by nonwhite noise in some specific situations. In this paper, general noise disturbance, which may be nonwhite, is introduced to NNs. Since NNs with nonwhite noise cannot be described by Ito integral equation, a novel modeling method of stochastic NNs is utilized. By a framework in light of random field approach and Lyapunov theory, the global asymptotic stability and stabilization in probability or in the mean square of NNs with general noise are analyzed, respectively. Criteria for the concerned systems based on linear matrix inequality are proposed. Some examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.",4
Robust C-Loss Kernel Classifiers.,"The correntropy-induced loss (C-loss) function has the nice property of being robust to outliers. In this paper, we study the C-loss kernel classifier with the Tikhonov regularization term, which is used to avoid overfitting. After using the half-quadratic optimization algorithm, which converges much faster than the gradient optimization algorithm, we find out that the resulting C-loss kernel classifier is equivalent to an iterative weighted least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). This relationship helps explain the robustness of iterative weighted LS-SVM from the correntropy and density estimation perspectives. On the large-scale data sets which have low-rank Gram matrices, we suggest to use incomplete Cholesky decomposition to speed up the training process. Moreover, we use the representer theorem to improve the sparseness of the resulting C-loss kernel classifier. Experimental results confirm that our methods are more robust to outliers than the existing common classifiers.",4
Supervised Discrete Hashing With Relaxation.,"Data-dependent hashing has recently attracted attention due to being able to support efficient retrieval and storage of high-dimensional data, such as documents, images, and videos. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based hashing method called ""supervised discrete hashing with relaxation"" (SDHR) based on ""supervised discrete hashing"" (SDH). SDH uses ordinary least squares regression and traditional zero-one matrix encoding of class label information as the regression target (code words), thus fixing the regression target. In SDHR, the regression target is instead optimized. The optimized regression target matrix satisfies a large margin constraint for correct classification of each example. Compared with SDH, which uses the traditional zero-one matrix, SDHR utilizes the learned regression target matrix and, therefore, more accurately measures the classification error of the regression model and is more flexible. As expected, SDHR generally outperforms SDH. Experimental results on two large-scale image data sets (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) and a large-scale and challenging face data set (FRGC) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SDHR.",4
Kernel-Based Multilayer Extreme Learning Machines for Representation Learning.,"Recently, multilayer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) was applied to stacked autoencoder (SAE) for representation learning. In contrast to traditional SAE, the training time of ML-ELM is significantly reduced from hours to seconds with high accuracy. However, ML-ELM suffers from several drawbacks: 1) manual tuning on the number of hidden nodes in every layer is an uncertain factor to training time and generalization; 2) random projection of input weights and bias in every layer of ML-ELM leads to suboptimal model generalization; 3) the pseudoinverse solution for output weights in every layer incurs relatively large reconstruction error; and 4) the storage and execution time for transformation matrices in representation learning are proportional to the number of hidden layers. Inspired by kernel learning, a kernel version of ML-ELM is developed, namely, multilayer kernel ELM (ML-KELM), whose contributions are: 1) elimination of manual tuning on the number of hidden nodes in every layer; 2) no random projection mechanism so as to obtain optimal model generalization; 3) exact inverse solution for output weights is guaranteed under invertible kernel matrix, resulting to smaller reconstruction error; and 4) all transformation matrices are unified into two matrices only, so that storage can be reduced and may shorten model execution time. Benchmark data sets of different sizes have been employed for the evaluation of ML-KELM. Experimental results have verified the contributions of the proposed ML-KELM. The improvement in accuracy over benchmark data sets is up to 7%.",4
Terminal Sliding Mode-Based Consensus Tracking Control for Networked Uncertain Mechanical Systems on Digraphs.,This brief investigates the finite-time consensus tracking control problem for networked uncertain mechanical systems on digraphs. A new terminal sliding-mode-based cooperative control scheme is developed to guarantee that the tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small bound around zero in finite time. All the networked systems can have different dynamics and all the dynamics are unknown. A neural network is used at each node to approximate the local unknown dynamics. The control schemes are implemented in a fully distributed manner. The proposed control method eliminates some limitations in the existing terminal sliding-mode-based consensus control methods and extends the existing analysis methods to the case of directed graphs. Simulation results on networked robot manipulators are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.,4
Robust DLPP With Nongreedy $\ell _1$ -Norm Minimization and Maximization.,"Recently, discriminant locality preserving projection based on L1-norm (DLPP-L1) was developed for robust subspace learning and image classification. It obtains projection vectors by greedy strategy, i.e., all projection vectors are optimized individually through maximizing the objective function. Thus, the obtained solution does not necessarily best optimize the corresponding trace ratio optimization algorithm, which is the essential objective function for general dimensionality reduction. It results in insufficient recognition accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose a nongreedy algorithm to solve the trace ratio formula of DLPP-L1, and analyze its convergence. Experimental results on three databases illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",4
Optimal Switching of DC-DC Power Converters Using Approximate Dynamic Programming.,"Optimal switching between different topologies in step-down dc-dc voltage converters, with nonideal inductors and capacitors, is investigated in this paper. Challenges including constraint on the inductor current and voltage leakages across the capacitor (due to switching) are incorporated. The objective is generating the desired voltage with low ripples and high robustness toward line and load disturbances. A previously developed tool, which is based on approximate dynamic programming, is adapted for this application. The scheme leads to tuning a parametric function approximator to provide optimal switching in a feedback form. No fixed cycle time is assumed, as the cycle time and the duty ratio will be adjusted on the fly in an optimal fashion. The controller demonstrates good capabilities in controlling the system even under parameter uncertainties. Finally, some modifications on the scheme are conducted to handle optimal switching problems with state jumps at the switching times.",4
Stability of Rotor Hopfield Neural Networks With Synchronous Mode.,"A complex-valued Hopfield neural network (CHNN) is a model of a Hopfield neural network using multistate neurons. The stability conditions of CHNNs have been widely studied. A CHNN with a synchronous mode will converge to a fixed point or a cycle of length 2. A rotor Hopfield neural network (RHNN) is also a model of a multistate Hopfield neural network. RHNNs have much higher storage capacity and noise tolerance than CHNNs. We extend the theories regarding the stability of CHNNs to RHNNs. In addition, we investigate the stability of RHNNs with the projection rule. Although a CHNN with projection rule can be trapped at a cycle, an RHNN with projection rule converges to a fixed point. This is one of the great advantages of RHNNs.",4
Dissipativity Analysis for Stochastic Memristive Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays: A Discrete-Time Case.,"In this paper, the dissipativity problem of discrete-time memristive neural networks (DMNNs) with time-varying delays and stochastic perturbation is investigated. A class of logical switched functions are put forward to reflect the memristor-based switched property of connection weights, and the DMNNs are then recast into a tractable model. Based on the tractable model, the robust analysis method and Refined Jensen-based inequalities are applied to establish some sufficient conditions that ensure the of DMNNs. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.",4
A Locality-Constrained and Label Embedding Dictionary Learning Algorithm for Image Classification.,"Locality and label information of training samples play an important role in image classification. However, previous dictionary learning algorithms do not take the locality and label information of atoms into account together in the learning process, and thus their performance is limited. In this paper, a discriminative dictionary learning algorithm, called the locality-constrained and label embedding dictionary learning (LCLE-DL) algorithm, was proposed for image classification. First, the locality information was preserved using the graph Laplacian matrix of the learned dictionary instead of the conventional one derived from the training samples. Then, the label embedding term was constructed using the label information of atoms instead of the classification error term, which contained discriminating information of the learned dictionary. The optimal coding coefficients derived by the locality-based and label-based reconstruction were effective for image classification. Experimental results demonstrated that the LCLE-DL algorithm can achieve better performance than some state-of-the-art algorithms.",4
Global Mittag-Leffler Stabilization of Fractional-Order Memristive Neural Networks.,"According to conventional memristive neural network theories, neurodynamic properties are powerful tools for solving many problems in the areas of brain-like associative learning, dynamic information storage or retrieval, etc. However, as have often been noted in most fractional-order systems, system analysis approaches for integral-order systems could not be directly extended and applied to deal with fractional-order systems, and consequently, it raises difficult issues in analyzing and controlling the fractional-order memristive neural networks. By using the set-valued maps and fractional-order differential inclusions, then aided by a newly proposed fractional derivative inequality, this paper investigates the global Mittag-Leffler stabilization for a class of fractional-order memristive neural networks. Two types of control rules (i.e., state feedback stabilizing control and output feedback stabilizing control) are designed for the stabilization of fractional-order memristive neural networks, while a list of stabilization criteria is established. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and characteristics of the obtained theoretical results.",4
Asymmetric Actuator Backlash Compensation in Quantized Adaptive Control of Uncertain Networked Nonlinear Systems.,"This paper mainly aims at the problem of adaptive quantized control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems preceded by asymmetric actuator backlash. One challenging problem that blocks the construction of our control scheme is that the real control signal is wrapped in the coupling of quantization effect and nonsmooth backlash nonlinearity. To resolve this challenge, this paper presents a two-stage separation approach established on two new technical components, which are the approximate asymmetric backlash model and the nonlinear decomposition of quantizer, respectively. Then the real control is successfully separated from the coupling dynamics. Furthermore, by employing the neural networks and adaptation method in control design, a quantized controller is developed to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of tracking error to an adjustable region of zero and uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals. Eventually, simulations are conducted to support our theoretical results.",4
Value and Policy Iterations in Optimal Control and Adaptive Dynamic Programming.,"In this paper, we consider discrete-time infinite horizon problems of optimal control to a terminal set of states. These are the problems that are often taken as the starting point for adaptive dynamic programming. Under very general assumptions, we establish the uniqueness of the solution of Bellman's equation, and we provide convergence results for value and policy iterations.",4
Asynchronous Dissipative State Estimation for Stochastic Complex Networks With Quantized Jumping Coupling and Uncertain Measurements.,"This paper addresses the problem of state estimation for a class of discrete-time stochastic complex networks with a constrained and randomly varying coupling and uncertain measurements. The randomly varying coupling is governed by a Markov chain, and the capacity constraint is handled by introducing a logarithmic quantizer. The uncertainty of measurements is modeled by a multiplicative noise. An asynchronous estimator is designed to overcome the difficulty that each node cannot access to the coupling information, and an augmented estimation error system is obtained using the Kronecker product. Sufficient conditions are established, which guarantee that the estimation error system is stochastically stable and achieves the strict (Q, S, R)-gamma-dissipativity. Then, the estimator gains are derived using the linear matrix inequality method. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed new design techniques.",4
Propagation of Collective Temporal Regularity in Noisy Hierarchical Networks.,"Neuronal communication between different brain areas is achieved in terms of spikes. Consequently, spike-time regularity is closely related to many cognitive tasks and timing precision of neural information processing. A recent experiment on primate parietal cortex reports that spike-time regularity increases consistently from primary sensory to higher cortical regions. This observation conflicts with the influential view that spikes in the neocortex are fundamentally irregular. To uncover the underlying network mechanism, we construct a multilayered feedforward neural information transmission pathway and investigate how spike-time regularity evolves across subsequent layers. Numerical results reveal that despite the obviously irregular spiking patterns in previous several layers, neurons in downstream layers can generate rather regular spikes, which depends on the network topology. In particular, we find that collective temporal regularity in deeper layers exhibits resonance-like behavior with respect to both synaptic connection probability and synaptic weight, i.e., the optimal topology parameter maximizes the spike-timing regularity. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that synaptic properties, including inhibition, synaptic transient dynamics, and plasticity, have significant impacts on spike-timing regularity propagation. The emergence of the increasingly regular spiking (RS) patterns in higher parietal regions can, thus, be viewed as a natural consequence of spiking activity propagation between different brain areas. Finally, we validate an important function served by increased RS: promoting reliable propagation of spike-rate signals across downstream layers.",4
Localized Multiple Kernel Learning With Dynamical Clustering and Matrix Regularization.,"Localized multiple kernel learning (LMKL) is an attractive strategy for combining multiple heterogeneous features with regard to their discriminative power for each individual sample. However, the learning of numerous local solutions may not scale well even for a moderately sized training set, and the independently learned local models may suffer from overfitting. Hence, in existing local methods, the distributed samples are typically assumed to share the same weights, and various unsupervised clustering methods are applied as preprocessing. In this paper, to enable the learner to discover and benefit from the underlying local coherence and diversity of the samples, we incorporate the clustering procedure into the canonical support vector machine-based LMKL framework. Then, to explore the relatedness among different samples, which has been ignored in a vector -norm analysis, we organize the cluster-specific kernel weights into a matrix and introduce a matrix-based extension of the -norm for constraint enforcement. By casting the joint optimization problem as a problem of alternating optimization, we show how the cluster structure is gradually revealed and how the matrix-regularized kernel weights are obtained. A theoretical analysis of such a regularizer is performed using a Rademacher complexity bound, and complementary empirical experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.",4
Stabilization of Neural-Network-Based Control Systems via Event-Triggered Control With Nonperiodic Sampled Data.,"This paper focuses on a problem of event-triggered stabilization for a class of nonuniformly sampled neural-network-based control systems (NNBCSs). First, a new event-triggered data transmission mechanism is designed based on the nonperiodic sampled data. Different from the previous works, the proposed triggering scheme enables the NNBCSs design to enjoy the advantages of both nonuniform and event-triggered sampling schemes. Second, under the nonperiodic event-triggered data transmission scheme, the nonperiodic sampled-data three-layer fully connected feedforward neural-network (TLFCFFNN)-based event-triggered controller is constructed, and the resulting closed-loop TLFCFFNN-based event-triggered control system is modeled as a state delay system based on time-delay system modeling approach. Then, the stability criteria for the closed-loop system is formulated using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Third, the sufficient conditions for the codesign of the TLFCFFNN-based controller and triggering parameters are given in terms of solvability of matrix inequalities to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system and an upper bound on the given cost function while reducing the updates of the controller. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed results.",4
A Deep Convolutional Coupling Network for Change Detection Based on Heterogeneous Optical and Radar Images.,"We propose an unsupervised deep convolutional coupling network for change detection based on two heterogeneous images acquired by optical sensors and radars on different dates. Most existing change detection methods are based on homogeneous images. Due to the complementary properties of optical and radar sensors, there is an increasing interest in change detection based on heterogeneous images. The proposed network is symmetric with each side consisting of one convolutional layer and several coupling layers. The two input images connected with the two sides of the network, respectively, are transformed into a feature space where their feature representations become more consistent. In this feature space, the different map is calculated, which then leads to the ultimate detection map by applying a thresholding algorithm. The network parameters are learned by optimizing a coupling function. The learning process is unsupervised, which is different from most existing change detection methods based on heterogeneous images. Experimental results on both homogenous and heterogeneous images demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed network compared with several existing approaches.",4
Synchronization of General Chaotic Neural Networks With Nonuniform Sampling and Packet Missing: A Switched System Approach.,"This paper is concerned with the exponential synchronization issue of general chaotic neural networks subject to nonuniform sampling and control packet missing in the frame of the zero-input strategy. Based on this strategy, we make use of the switched system model to describe the synchronization error system. First, when the missing of control packet does not occur, an exponential stability criterion with less conservatism is established for the resultant synchronization error systems via a superior time-dependent Lyapunov functional and the convex optimization approach. The characteristics induced by nonuniform sampling can be used to the full because of the structure and property of the constructed Lyapunov functional, that is not necessary to be positive definite except sampling times. Then, a criterion is obtained to guarantee that the general chaotic neural networks are synchronous exponentially when the missing of control packet occurs by means of the average dwell-time technique. An explicit expression of the sampled-data static output feedback controller is also gained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new design methods is shown via two examples.",4
Insights Into the Robustness of Minimum Error Entropy Estimation.,"The minimum error entropy (MEE) is an important and highly effective optimization criterion in information theoretic learning (ITL). For regression problems, MEE aims at minimizing the entropy of the prediction error such that the estimated model preserves the information of the data generating system as much as possible. In many real world applications, the MEE estimator can outperform significantly the well-known minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and show strong robustness to noises especially when data are contaminated by non-Gaussian (multimodal, heavy tailed, discrete valued, and so on) noises. In this brief, we present some theoretical results on the robustness of MEE. For a one-parameter linear errors-in-variables (EIV) model and under some conditions, we derive a region that contains the MEE solution, which suggests that the MEE estimate can be very close to the true value of the unknown parameter even in presence of arbitrarily large outliers in both input and output variables. Theoretical prediction is verified by an illustrative example.",4
A One-Layer Recurrent Neural Network for Constrained Complex-Variable Convex Optimization.,"In this paper, based on calculus and penalty method, a one-layer recurrent neural network is proposed for solving constrained complex-variable convex optimization. It is proved that for any initial point from a given domain, the state of the proposed neural network reaches the feasible region in finite time and converges to an optimal solution of the constrained complex-variable convex optimization finally. In contrast to existing neural networks for complex-variable convex optimization, the proposed neural network has a lower model complexity and better convergence. Some numerical examples and application are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed neural network.",4
Nonlinear Process Fault Diagnosis Based on Serial Principal Component Analysis.,"Many industrial processes contain both linear and nonlinear parts, and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), widely used in nonlinear process monitoring, may not offer the most effective means for dealing with these nonlinear processes. This paper proposes a new hybrid linear-nonlinear statistical modeling approach for nonlinear process monitoring by closely integrating linear principal component analysis (PCA) and nonlinear KPCA using a serial model structure, which we refer to as serial PCA (SPCA). Specifically, PCA is first applied to extract PCs as linear features, and to decompose the data into the PC subspace and residual subspace (RS). Then, KPCA is performed in the RS to extract the nonlinear PCs as nonlinear features. Two monitoring statistics are constructed for fault detection, based on both the linear and nonlinear features extracted by the proposed SPCA. To effectively perform fault identification after a fault is detected, an SPCA similarity factor method is built for fault recognition, which fuses both the linear and nonlinear features. Unlike PCA and KPCA, the proposed method takes into account both linear and nonlinear PCs simultaneously, and therefore, it can better exploit the underlying process's structure to enhance fault diagnosis performance. Two case studies involving a simulated nonlinear process and the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process demonstrate that the proposed SPCA approach is more effective than the existing state-of-the-art approach based on KPCA alone, in terms of nonlinear process fault detection and identification.",4
Decoupled ARX and RBF Neural Network Modeling Using PCA and GA Optimization for Nonlinear Distributed Parameter Systems.,"Modeling of distributed parameter systems is difficult because of their nonlinearity and infinite-dimensional characteristics. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), a hybrid modeling strategy that consists of a decoupled linear autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model and a nonlinear radial basis function (RBF) neural network model are proposed. The spatial-temporal output is first divided into a few dominant spatial basis functions and finite-dimensional temporal series by PCA. Then, a decoupled ARX model is designed to model the linear dynamics of the dominant modes of the time series. The nonlinear residual part is subsequently parameterized by RBFs, where genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize their hidden layer structure and the parameters. Finally, the nonlinear spatial-temporal dynamic system is obtained after the time/space reconstruction. Simulation results of a catalytic rod and a heat conduction equation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy compared to several other methods.",4
Forward Stagewise Additive Model for Collaborative Multiview Boosting.,"Multiview assisted learning has gained significant attention in recent years in supervised learning genre. Availability of high-performance computing devices enables learning algorithms to search simultaneously over multiple views or feature spaces to obtain an optimum classification performance. This paper is a pioneering attempt of formulating a mathematical foundation for realizing a multiview aided collaborative boosting architecture for multiclass classification. Most of the present algorithms apply multiview learning heuristically without exploring the fundamental mathematical changes imposed on traditional boosting. Also, most of the algorithms are restricted to two class or view setting. Our proposed mathematical framework enables collaborative boosting across any finite-dimensional view spaces for multiclass learning. The boosting framework is based on a forward stagewise additive model, which minimizes a novel exponential loss function. We show that the exponential loss function essentially captures the difficulty of a training sample space instead of the traditional ""1/0"" loss. The new algorithm restricts a weak view from overlearning and thereby preventing overfitting. The model is inspired by our earlier attempt on collaborative boosting, which was devoid of mathematical justification. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge much nearer to global minimum in the exponential loss space and thus supersedes our previous algorithm. This paper also presents analytical and numerical analyses of convergence and margin bounds for multiview boosting algorithms and we show that our proposed ensemble learning manifests lower error bound and higher margin compared with our previous model. Also, the proposed model is compared with traditional boosting and recent multiview boosting algorithms. In the majority of instances, the new algorithm manifests a faster rate of convergence on training set error and also simultaneously offers better generalization performance. The kappa-error diagram analysis reveals the robustness of the proposed boosting framework to labeling noise.",4
Learning to Predict Eye Fixations via Multiresolution Convolutional Neural Networks.,"Eye movements in the case of freely viewing natural scenes are believed to be guided by local contrast, global contrast, and top-down visual factors. Although a lot of previous works have explored these three saliency cues for several years, there still exists much room for improvement on how to model them and integrate them effectively. This paper proposes a novel computation model to predict eye fixations, which adopts a multiresolution convolutional neural network (Mr-CNN) to infer these three types of saliency cues from raw image data simultaneously. The proposed Mr-CNN is trained directly from fixation and nonfixation pixels with multiresolution input image regions with different contexts. It utilizes image pixels as inputs and eye fixation points as labels. Then, both the local and global contrasts are learned by fusing information in multiple contexts. Meanwhile, various top-down factors are learned in higher layers. Finally, optimal combination of top-down factors and bottom-up contrasts can be learned to predict eye fixations. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several publically available benchmark databases, demonstrating the superiority of Mr-CNN. We also apply our method to the RGB-D image saliency detection problem. Through learning saliency cues induced by depth and RGB information on pixel level jointly and their interactions, our model achieves better performance on predicting eye fixations in RGB-D images.",4
Constrained Null Space Component Analysis for Semiblind Source Separation Problem.,"The blind source separation (BSS) problem extracts unknown sources from observations of their unknown mixtures. A current trend in BSS is the semiblind approach, which incorporates prior information on sources or how the sources are mixed. The constrained independent component analysis (ICA) approach has been studied to impose constraints on the famous ICA framework. We introduced an alternative approach based on the null space component (NCA) framework and referred to the approach as the c-NCA approach. We also presented the c-NCA algorithm that uses signal-dependent semidefinite operators, which is a bilinear mapping, as signatures for operator design in the c-NCA approach. Theoretically, we showed that the source estimation of the c-NCA algorithm converges with a convergence rate dependent on the decay of the sequence, obtained by applying the estimated operators on corresponding sources. The c-NCA can be formulated as a deterministic constrained optimization method, and thus, it can take advantage of solvers developed in optimization society for solving the BSS problem. As examples, we demonstrated electroencephalogram interference rejection problems can be solved by the c-NCA with proximal splitting algorithms by incorporating a sparsity-enforcing separation model and considering the case when reference signals are available.",4
Real-Time Decentralized Neural Control via Backstepping for a Robotic Arm Powered by Industrial Servomotors.,"This paper presents a continuous-time decentralized neural control scheme for trajectory tracking of a two degrees of freedom direct drive vertical robotic arm. A decentralized recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN) structure is proposed to identify online, in a series-parallel configuration and using the filtered error learning law, the dynamics of the plant. Based on the RHONN subsystems, a local neural controller is derived via backstepping approach. The effectiveness of the decentralized neural controller is validated on a robotic arm platform, of our own design and unknown parameters, which uses industrial servomotors to drive the joints.",4
Network Unfolding Map by Vertex-Edge Dynamics Modeling.,"The emergence of collective dynamics in neural networks is a mechanism of the animal and human brain for information processing. In this paper, we develop a computational technique using distributed processing elements in a complex network, which are called particles, to solve semisupervised learning problems. Three actions govern the particles' dynamics: generation, walking, and absorption. Labeled vertices generate new particles that compete against rival particles for edge domination. Active particles randomly walk in the network until they are absorbed by either a rival vertex or an edge currently dominated by rival particles. The result from the model evolution consists of sets of edges arranged by the label dominance. Each set tends to form a connected subnetwork to represent a data class. Although the intrinsic dynamics of the model is a stochastic one, we prove that there exists a deterministic version with largely reduced computational complexity; specifically, with linear growth. Furthermore, the edge domination process corresponds to an unfolding map in such way that edges ""stretch"" and ""shrink"" according to the vertex-edge dynamics. Consequently, the unfolding effect summarizes the relevant relationships between vertices and the uncovered data classes. The proposed model captures important details of connectivity patterns over the vertex-edge dynamics evolution, in contrast to the previous approaches, which focused on only vertex or only edge dynamics. Computer simulations reveal that the new model can identify nonlinear features in both real and artificial data, including boundaries between distinct classes and overlapping structures of data.",4
Passivity and Output Synchronization of Complex Dynamical Networks With Fixed and Adaptive Coupling Strength.,"This paper considers a complex dynamical network model, in which the input and output vectors have different dimensions. We, respectively, investigate the passivity and the relationship between output strict passivity and output synchronization of the complex dynamical network with fixed and adaptive coupling strength. First, two new passivity definitions are proposed, which generalize some existing concepts of passivity. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functional, some sufficient conditions ensuring the passivity, input strict passivity and output strict passivity are derived for the complex dynamical network with fixed coupling strength. In addition, we also reveal the relationship between output strict passivity and output synchronization of the complex dynamical network with fixed coupling strength. By employing the relationship between output strict passivity and output synchronization, a sufficient condition for output synchronization of the complex dynamical network with fixed coupling strength is established. Then, we extend these results to the case when the coupling strength is adaptively adjusted. Finally, two examples with numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.",4
Multivariate Cryptography Based on Clipped Hopfield Neural Network.,"Designing secure and efficient multivariate public key cryptosystems [multivariate cryptography (MVC)] to strengthen the security of RSA and ECC in conventional and quantum computational environment continues to be a challenging research in recent years. In this paper, we will describe multivariate public key cryptosystems based on extended Clipped Hopfield Neural Network (CHNN) and implement it using the MVC (CHNN-MVC) framework operated in space. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is extended into the matrix field, which illustrates the feasibility of its new applications in both classic and postquantum cryptography. The efficiency and security of our proposed new public key cryptosystem CHNN-MVC are simulated and found to be NP-hard. The proposed algorithm will strengthen multivariate public key cryptosystems and allows hardware realization practicality.",4
Concept Factorization With Adaptive Neighbors for Document Clustering.,"In this paper, a novel concept factorization (CF) method, called CF with adaptive neighbors (CFANs), is proposed. The idea of CFAN is to integrate an ANs regularization constraint into the CF decomposition. The goal of CFAN is to extract the representation space that maintains geometrical neighborhood structure of the data. Similar to the existing graph-regularized CF, CFAN builds a neighbor graph weights matrix. The key difference is that the CFAN performs dimensionality reduction and finds the neighbor graph weights matrix simultaneously. An efficient algorithm is also derived to solve the proposed problem. We apply the proposed method to the problem of document clustering on the 20 Newsgroups, Reuters-21578, and TDT2 document data sets. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",4
Multisynchronization of Coupled Heterogeneous Genetic Oscillator Networks via Partial Impulsive Control.,"This paper focuses on the collective dynamics of multisynchronization among heterogeneous genetic oscillators under a partial impulsive control strategy. The coupled nonidentical genetic oscillators are modeled by differential equations with uncertainties. The definition of multisynchronization is proposed to describe some more general synchronization behaviors in the real. Considering that each genetic oscillator consists of a large number of biochemical molecules, we design a more manageable impulsive strategy for dynamic networks to achieve multisynchronization. Not all the molecules but only a small fraction of them in each genetic oscillator are controlled at each impulsive instant. Theoretical analysis of multisynchronization is carried out by the control theory approach, and a sufficient condition of partial impulsive controller for multisynchronization with given error bounds is established. At last, numerical simulations are exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.",4
A Novel Algorithm for Learning Sparse Spatio-Spectral Patterns for Event-Related Potentials.,"Recent years have witnessed brain-computer interface (BCI) as a promising technology for integrating human intelligence and machine intelligence. Currently, event-related potential (ERP)-based BCI is an important branch of noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs. Extracting ERPs from a limited number of trials remains challenging due to their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low spatial resolution caused by volume conduction. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for trial-by-trial concatenated EEG, in which the concatenated ERPs are expressed as a linear combination of a set of discrete sine and cosine bases. The bases are simply determined by the data length of a single trial. A sparse prior on the rank of the spatio-spectral pattern matrix is introduced into the model to allow the number of components to be automatically determined. A maximum posterior estimation algorithm based on cyclic descent is then developed to estimate the spatiospectral patterns. A spatial filter can then be obtained by maximizing the SNR of the ERP components. Experiments on both synthetic data and real N170 ERP from 13 subjects were conducted to test the efficacy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can estimate the ERPs more accurately than the several state-of-the-art algorithms.",4
Neuroadaptive Fault-Tolerant Control of Nonlinear Systems Under Output Constraints and Actuation Faults.,"In this paper, a neuroadaptive fault-tolerant tracking control method is proposed for a class of time-delay pure-feedback systems in the presence of external disturbances and actuation faults. The proposed controller can achieve prescribed transient and steady-state performance, despite uncertain time delays and output constraints as well as actuation faults. By combining a tangent barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii function with the dynamic surface control technique, the neural network unit in the developed control scheme is able to take its action from the very beginning and play its learning/approximating role safely during the entire system operational envelope, leading to enhanced control performance without the danger of violating compact set precondition. Furthermore, prescribed transient performance and output constraints are strictly ensured in the presence of nonaffine uncertainties, external disturbances, and undetectable actuation faults. The control strategy is also validated by numerical simulation.",4
Deep Logic Networks: Inserting and Extracting Knowledge From Deep Belief Networks.,"Developments in deep learning have seen the use of layerwise unsupervised learning combined with supervised learning for fine-tuning. With this layerwise approach, a deep network can be seen as a more modular system that lends itself well to learning representations. In this paper, we investigate whether such modularity can be useful to the insertion of background knowledge into deep networks, whether it can improve learning performance when it is available, and to the extraction of knowledge from trained deep networks, and whether it can offer a better understanding of the representations learned by such networks. To this end, we use a simple symbolic language-a set of logical rules that we call confidence rules-and show that it is suitable for the representation of quantitative reasoning in deep networks. We show by knowledge extraction that confidence rules can offer a low-cost representation for layerwise networks (or restricted Boltzmann machines). We also show that layerwise extraction can produce an improvement in the accuracy of deep belief networks. Furthermore, the proposed symbolic characterization of deep networks provides a novel method for the insertion of prior knowledge and training of deep networks. With the use of this method, a deep neural-symbolic system is proposed and evaluated, with the experimental results indicating that modularity through the use of confidence rules and knowledge insertion can be beneficial to network performance.",4
Synchronization of an Inertial Neural Network With Time-Varying Delays and Its Application to Secure Communication.,"In this paper, synchronization of an inertial neural network with time-varying delays is investigated. Based on the variable transformation method, we transform the second-order differential equations into the first-order differential equations. Then, using suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and Jensen's inequality, the synchronization criteria are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, a feedback controller is designed to attain synchronization between the master and slave models, and to ensure that the error model is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical examples and simulations are presented to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Besides that, an image encryption algorithm is proposed based on the piecewise linear chaotic map and the chaotic inertial neural network. The chaotic signals obtained from the inertial neural network are utilized for the encryption process. Statistical analyses are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encryption algorithm. The results ascertain that the proposed encryption algorithm is efficient and reliable for secure communication applications.",4
Hysteretic Noisy Chaotic Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in OFDMA System.,"This paper addresses two-stage resource allocation in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access system. In the subcarrier allocation stage, hysteretic noisy chaotic neural network (HNCNN) with a newly established energy function is proposed for subcarrier allocation to improve the optimization performance and reduce the computational complexity. Activation functions with both anticlockwise and clockwise hysteretic loops are applied to the HNCNN. A new energy function is established for an objective function, which can be calculated offline, resulting in a lower computational complexity in solving subcarrier allocation than the previous energy function. In the power allocation stage, the water-filling algorithm is employed to attain optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that the energy function established in this paper can decrease the runtimes of the neural networks, and that the HNCNN with both anticlockwise and clockwise hysteretic-loop activation functions can improve probabilities of feasible and optimal solutions at higher noises. The two-stage algorithm in this paper outperforms the previous algorithms in fairness, system throughput, and resource utilization.",4
Decorrelation of Neutral Vector Variables: Theory and Applications.,"In this paper, we propose novel strategies for neutral vector variable decorrelation. Two fundamental invertible transformations, namely, serial nonlinear transformation and parallel nonlinear transformation, are proposed to carry out the decorrelation. For a neutral vector variable, which is not multivariate-Gaussian distributed, the conventional principal component analysis cannot yield mutually independent scalar variables. With the two proposed transformations, a highly negatively correlated neutral vector can be transformed to a set of mutually independent scalar variables with the same degrees of freedom. We also evaluate the decorrelation performances for the vectors generated from a single Dirichlet distribution and a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. The mutual independence is verified with the distance correlation measurement. The advantages of the proposed decorrelation strategies are intensively studied and demonstrated with synthesized data and practical application evaluations.",4
An Exemplar-Based Multi-View Domain Generalization Framework for Visual Recognition.,"In this paper, we propose a new exemplar-based multi-view domain generalization (EMVDG) framework for visual recognition by learning robust classifier that are able to generalize well to arbitrary target domain based on the training samples with multiple types of features (i.e., multi-view features). In this framework, we aim to address two issues simultaneously. First, the distribution of training samples (i.e., the source domain) is often considerably different from that of testing samples (i.e., the target domain), so the performance of the classifiers learnt on the source domain may drop significantly on the target domain. Moreover, the testing data are often unseen during the training procedure. Second, when the training data are associated with multi-view features, the recognition performance can be further improved by exploiting the relation among multiple types of features. To address the first issue, considering that it has been shown that fusing multiple SVM classifiers can enhance the domain generalization ability, we build our EMVDG framework upon exemplar SVMs (ESVMs), in which a set of ESVM classifiers are learnt with each one trained based on one positive training sample and all the negative training samples. When the source domain contains multiple latent domains, the learnt ESVM classifiers are expected to be grouped into multiple clusters. To address the second issue, we propose two approaches under the EMVDG framework based on the consensus principle and the complementary principle, respectively. Specifically, we propose an EMVDG_CO method by adding a co-regularizer to enforce the cluster structures of ESVM classifiers on different views to be consistent based on the consensus principle. Inspired by multiple kernel learning, we also propose another EMVDG_MK method by fusing the ESVM classifiers from different views based on the complementary principle. In addition, we further extend our EMVDG framework to exemplar-based multi-view domain adaptation (EMVDA) framework when the unlabeled target domain data are available during the training procedure. The effectiveness of our EMVDG and EMVDA frameworks for visual recognition is clearly demonstrated by comprehensive experiments on three benchmark data sets.",4
Face Alignment With Deep Regression.,"In this paper, we present a deep regression approach for face alignment. The deep regressor is a neural network that consists of a global layer and multistage local layers. The global layer estimates the initial face shape from the whole image, while the following local layers iteratively update the shape with local image observations. Combining standard derivations and numerical approximations, we make all layers able to backpropagate error differentials, so that we can apply the standard backpropagation to jointly learn the parameters from all layers. We show that the resulting deep regressor gradually and evenly approaches the true facial landmarks stage by stage, avoiding the tendency that often occurs in the cascaded regression methods and deteriorates the overall performance: yielding early stage regressors with high alignment accuracy gains but later stage regressors with low alignment accuracy gains. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach brings significant improvements over previous cascaded regression algorithms.",4
Adaptive Iterative Learning Control for Linear Systems With Binary-Valued Observations.,"This brief presents a novel adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm for a class of single parameter systems with binary-valued observations. Using the certainty equivalence principle, the adaptive ILC algorithm is designed by employing a projection identification algorithm along the iteration axis. It is shown that, even though the available system information is very limited and the desired trajectory is iteration-varying, the proposed adaptive ILC algorithm can guarantee the convergence of parameter estimation over a finite-time interval along the iterative axis; meanwhile, the tracking error is pointwise convergence asymptotically. Two examples are given to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",4
Online Optimization With Costly and Noisy Measurements Using Random Fourier Expansions.,"This paper analyzes data-based online nonlinear extremum-seeker (DONE), an online optimization algorithm that iteratively minimizes an unknown function based on costly and noisy measurements. The algorithm maintains a surrogate of the unknown function in the form of a random Fourier expansion. The surrogate is updated whenever a new measurement is available, and then used to determine the next measurement point. The algorithm is comparable with Bayesian optimization algorithms, but its computational complexity per iteration does not depend on the number of measurements. We derive several theoretical results that provide insight on how the hyperparameters of the algorithm should be chosen. The algorithm is compared with a Bayesian optimization algorithm for an analytic benchmark problem and three applications, namely, optical coherence tomography, optical beam-forming network tuning, and robot arm control. It is found that the DONE algorithm is significantly faster than Bayesian optimization in the discussed problems while achieving a similar or better performance.",4
A Rotational Motion Perception Neural Network Based on Asymmetric Spatiotemporal Visual Information Processing.,"All complex motion patterns can be decomposed into several elements, including translation, expansion/contraction, and rotational motion. In biological vision systems, scientists have found that specific types of visual neurons have specific preferences to each of the three motion elements. There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perceptions; however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotational motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts-presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion. This research is a critical step further toward dynamic visual information processing.All complex motion patterns can be decomposed into several elements, including translation, expansion/contraction, and rotational motion.

Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Decentralized Fault-Tolerant Control for a Class of Interconnected Nonlinear Systems.,"This paper is concerned with the adaptive decentralized fault-tolerant tracking control problem for a class of uncertain interconnected nonlinear systems with unknown strong interconnections. An algebraic graph theory result is introduced to address the considered interconnections. In addition, to achieve the desirable tracking performance, a neural-network-based robust adaptive decentralized fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is given to compensate the actuator faults and system uncertainties. Furthermore, via the Lyapunov analysis method, it is proven that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are semiglobally bounded, and the tracking errors of each subsystem exponentially converge to a compact set, whose radius is adjustable by choosing different controller design parameters. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed FTC approach are illustrated with two simulated examples.",4
Distinct Variation Pattern Discovery Using Alternating Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis.,"Autoassociative neural networks (ANNs) have been proposed as a nonlinear extension of principal component analysis (PCA), which is commonly used to identify linear variation patterns in high-dimensional data. While principal component scores represent uncorrelated features, standard backpropagation methods for training ANNs provide no guarantee of producing distinct features, which is important for interpretability and for discovering the nature of the variation patterns in the data. Here, we present an alternating nonlinear PCA method, which encourages learning of distinct features in ANNs. A new measure motivated by the condition of orthogonal loadings in PCA is proposed for measuring the extent to which the nonlinear principal components represent distinct variation patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a simulated point cloud data set as well as a subset of the MNIST handwritten digits data. The results show that standard ANNs consistently mix the true variation sources in the low-dimensional representation learned by the model, whereas our alternating method produces solutions where the patterns are better separated in the low-dimensional space.",4
Development of Quantum Local Potential Function Networks Based on Quantum Assimilation and Subspace Division.,"The centers and radii of radial basis functions (RBFs) greatly affect the approximation capability of RBF networks (RBFNs). Traditional statistics-based approaches are widely used, but they may lack adaptivity to different data structures. Quantum clustering (QC), derived from quantum mechanics and the Schrodinger equation, demonstrates excellent capability in finding the structure and conformity toward data distribution. In this paper, a novel neural networks model called quantum local potential function networks (QLPFNs) is proposed. The QLPFN inherits the outstanding properties of QC by constructing the waves and the potential functions, and the level of data concentration can be discovered to obtain the inherent structures of the given data set. The local potential functions form the basic components of the QLPFN structure, which are automatically generated from the subsets of training data following specific subspace division procedures. Therefore, the QLPFN model in fact incorporates the level of data concentration as a computation technique, which is different from the classical RBFN model that exhibits radial symmetry toward specific centers. Some application examples are given in this paper to show the effectiveness of the QLPFN model.",4
A Bi-Criteria Active Learning Algorithm for Dynamic Data Streams.,"Active learning (AL) is a promising way to efficiently build up training sets with minimal supervision. A learner deliberately queries specific instances to tune the classifier's model using as few labels as possible. The challenge for streaming is that the data distribution may evolve over time, and therefore the model must adapt. Another challenge is the sampling bias where the sampled training set does not reflect the underlying data distribution. In the presence of concept drift, sampling bias is more likely to occur as the training set needs to represent the whole evolving data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel bi-criteria AL (BAL) approach that relies on two selection criteria, namely, label uncertainty criterion and density-based criterion. While the first criterion selects instances that are the most uncertain in terms of class membership, the latter dynamically curbs the sampling bias by weighting the samples to reflect on the true underlying distribution. To design and implement these two criteria for learning from streams, BAL adopts a Bayesian online learning approach and combines online classification and online clustering through the use of online logistic regression and online growing Gaussian mixture models, respectively. Empirical results obtained on standard synthetic and real-world benchmarks show the high performance of the proposed BAL method compared with the state-of-the-art AL methods.",4
On Global Dissipativity of Nonautonomous Neural Networks With Multiple Proportional Delays.,"This brief addresses the problem of global dissipativity analysis of nonautonomous neural networks with multiple proportional delays. By using a novel constructive approach based on some comparison techniques for differential inequalities, new explicit delay-independent conditions are derived using M-matrix theory to ensure the existence of generalized exponential attracting sets and the global dissipativity of the system. The method presented in this brief is also utilized to derive a generalized exponential estimate for a class of Halanay-type inequalities with proportional delays. Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and improvement of the obtained results.",4
An Efficient Representation-Based Method for Boundary Point and Outlier Detection.,"Detecting boundary points (including outliers) is often more interesting than detecting normal observations, since they represent valid, interesting, and potentially valuable patterns. Since data representation can uncover the intrinsic data structure, we present an efficient representation-based method for detecting such points, which are generally located around the margin of densely distributed data, such as a cluster. For each point, the negative components in its representation generally correspond to the boundary points among its affine combination of points. In the presented method, the reverse unreachability of a point is proposed to evaluate to what degree this observation is a boundary point. The reverse unreachability can be calculated by counting the number of zero and negative components in the representation. The reverse unreachability explicitly takes into account the global data structure and reveals the disconnectivity between a data point and other points. This paper reveals that the reverse unreachability of points with lower density has a higher score. Note that the score of reverse unreachability of an outlier is greater than that of a boundary point. The top- ranked points can thus be identified as outliers. The greater the value of the reverse unreachability, the more likely the point is a boundary point. Compared with related methods, our method better reflects the characteristics of the data, and simultaneously detects outliers and boundary points regardless of their distribution and the dimensionality of the space. Experimental results obtained for a number of synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",4
Event-Based Robust Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming.,"In this paper, the robust control problem for a class of continuous-time nonlinear system with unmatched uncertainties is investigated using an event-based control method. First, the robust control problem is transformed into a corresponding optimal control problem with an augmented control and an appropriate cost function. Under the event-based mechanism, we prove that the solution of the optimal control problem can asymptotically stabilize the uncertain system with an adaptive triggering condition. That is, the designed event-based controller is robust to the original uncertain system. Note that the event-based controller is updated only when the triggering condition is satisfied, which can save the communication resources between the plant and the controller. Then, a single network adaptive dynamic programming structure with experience replay technique is constructed to approach the optimal control policies. The stability of the closed-loop system with the event-based control policy and the augmented control policy is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach. Furthermore, we prove that the minimal intersample time is bounded by a nonzero positive constant, which excludes Zeno behavior during the learning process. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",4
A Consistent Model for Lazzaro Winner-Take-All Circuit With Invariant Subthreshold Behavior.,"This paper considers the basic Lazzaro winner-take-all analog computing circuit with N current inputs, N voltage outputs, and a bias current. Motivated by low-power applications, we find a mathematical accurate model of the network when all MOS devices remain inside the subthreshold region all along the transient. This involves analytical inequalities relating the range of admissible input currents to transistor parameters, to supply voltage, and to bias current. The restrictions are sufficiently weak to allow extra demands of functionality or performance. The technical novelty here is that by a slight cut of the maximal subthreshold domain and by choosing proper coordinates, we get a ordinary differential equation invariance problem on a rectangle of Re(N+1) space which is analytically tractable. A more precise localization of the asymptotically stable steady state inside the region of interest is also inferred. Although the work is mainly theoretical, an effort to infer simple, interpretable formulas useful for synthesis has been made. The results are numerically verified and their feasibility is discussed in detail. The subject matter is new and it is worth extending it to larger classes of circuits with regional behavior.",4
Group Component Analysis for Multiblock Data: Common and Individual Feature Extraction.,"Real-world data are often acquired as a collection of matrices rather than as a single matrix. Such multiblock data are naturally linked and typically share some common features while at the same time exhibiting their own individual features, reflecting the underlying data generation mechanisms. To exploit the linked nature of data, we propose a new framework for common and individual feature extraction (CIFE) which identifies and separates the common and individual features from the multiblock data. Two efficient algorithms termed common orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) are proposed to extract common basis is shared by all data, independent on whether the number of common components is known beforehand. Feature extraction is then performed on the common and individual subspaces separately, by incorporating dimensionality reduction and blind source separation techniques. Comprehensive experimental results on both the synthetic and real-world data demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed CIFE method in comparison with the state-of-the-art.",4
Echo State Networks With Orthogonal Pigeon-Inspired Optimization for Image Restoration.,"In this paper, a neurodynamic approach for image restoration is proposed. Image restoration is a process of estimating original images from blurred and/or noisy images. It can be considered as a mapping problem that can be solved by neural networks. Echo state network (ESN) is a recurrent neural network with a simplified training process, which is adopted to estimate the original images in this paper. The parameter selection is important to the performance of the ESN. Thus, the pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) approach is employed in the training process of the ESN to obtain desired parameters. Moreover, the orthogonal design strategy is utilized in the initialization of PIO to improve the diversity of individuals. The proposed method is tested on several deteriorated images with different sorts and levels of blur and/or noise. Results obtained by the improved ESN are compared with those obtained by several state-of-the-art methods. It is verified experimentally that better image restorations can be obtained for different blurred and/or noisy instances with the proposed neurodynamic method. In addition, the performance of the orthogonal PIO algorithm is compared with that of several existing bioinspired optimization algorithms to confirm its superiority.",4
Asymptotically Stable Adaptive-Optimal Control Algorithm With Saturating Actuators and Relaxed Persistence of Excitation.,"This paper proposes a control algorithm based on adaptive dynamic programming to solve the infinite-horizon optimal control problem for known deterministic nonlinear systems with saturating actuators and nonquadratic cost functionals. The algorithm is based on an actor/critic framework, where a critic neural network (NN) is used to learn the optimal cost, and an actor NN is used to learn the optimal control policy. The adaptive control nature of the algorithm requires a persistence of excitation condition to be a priori validated, but this can be relaxed using previously stored data concurrently with current data in the update of the critic NN. A robustifying control term is added to the controller to eliminate the effect of residual errors, leading to the asymptotically stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for a controlled Van der Pol oscillator and also for a power system plant.",4
Exponential Stability and Stabilization of Delayed Memristive Neural Networks Based on Quadratic Convex Combination Method.,"This paper is concerned with the exponential stability and stabilization of memristive neural networks (MNNs) with delays. First, we present some generalized double-integral inequalities, which include some existing inequalities as their special cases. Second, combining with quadratic convex combination method, these double-integral inequalities are employed to formulate a delay-dependent stability condition for MNNs with delays. Third, a state-dependent switching control law is obtained for MNNs with delays based on the proposed stability conditions. The desired feedback gain matrices are accomplished by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed results are tested by two numerical examples.",4
Feature Extraction Using Memristor Networks.,"Crossbar arrays of memristive elements are investigated for the implementation of dictionary learning and sparse coding of natural images. A winner-take-all training algorithm, in conjunction with Oja's rule, is used to learn an overcomplete dictionary of feature primitives that resemble Gabor filters. The dictionary is then used in the locally competitive algorithm to form a sparse representation of input images. The impacts of device nonlinearity and parameter variations are evaluated and a compensating procedure is proposed to ensure the robustness of the sparsification. It is shown that, with proper compensation, the memristor crossbar architecture can effectively perform sparse coding with distortion comparable with ideal software implementations at high sparsity, even in the presence of large device-to-device variations in the excess of 100%.",4
Optimizing Single-Trial EEG Classification by Stationary Matrix Logistic Regression in Brain-Computer Interface.,"In addition to the noisy and limited spatial resolution characteristics of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal, the intrinsic nonstationarity in the EEG data makes the single-trial EEG classification an even more challenging problem in brain-computer interface (BCI). Variations of the signal properties within a session often result in deteriorated classification performance. This is mainly attributed to the reason that the routine feature extraction or classification method does not take the changes in the signal into account. Although several extensions to the standard feature extraction method have been proposed to reduce the sensitivity to nonstationarity in data, they optimize different objective functions from that of the subsequent classification model, and thereby, the extracted features may not be optimized for the classification. In this paper, we propose an approach that directly optimizes the classifier's discriminativity and robustness against the within-session nonstationarity of the EEG data through a single optimization paradigm, and show that it can greatly improve the performance, in particular for the subjects who have difficulty in controlling a BCI. Moreover, the experimental results on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the compared approaches in reducing classification error rates.",4
Identification of Nonlinear Spatiotemporal Dynamical Systems With Nonuniform Observations Using Reproducing-Kernel-Based Integral Least Square Regulation.,"The identification of nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamical systems given by partial differential equations has attracted a lot of attention in the past decades. Several methods, such as searching principle-based algorithms, partially linear kernel methods, and coupled lattice methods, have been developed to address the identification problems. However, most existing methods have some restrictions on sampling processes in that the sampling intervals should usually be very small and uniformly distributed in spatiotemporal domains. These are actually not applicable for some practical applications. In this paper, to tackle this issue, a novel kernel-based learning algorithm named integral least square regularization regression (ILSRR) is proposed, which can be used to effectively achieve accurate derivative estimation for nonlinear functions in the time domain. With this technique, a discretization method named inverse meshless collocation is then developed to realize the dimensional reduction of the system to be identified. Thereafter, with this novel inverse meshless collocation model, the ILSRR, and a multiple-kernel-based learning algorithm, a multistep identification method is systematically proposed to address the identification problem of spatiotemporal systems with pointwise nonuniform observations. Numerical studies for benchmark systems with necessary discussions are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed method.",4
Multi-AUV Target Search Based on Bioinspired Neurodynamics Model in 3-D Underwater Environments.,"Target search in 3-D underwater environments is a challenge in multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) exploration. This paper focuses on an effective strategy for multi-AUV target search in the 3-D underwater environments with obstacles. First, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is applied to extract information of environment from the sonar data to build a grid map of the underwater environments. Second, a topologically organized bioinspired neurodynamics model based on the grid map is constructed to represent the dynamic environment. The target globally attracts the AUVs through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the model, while the obstacles locally push the AUVs away to avoid collision. Finally, the AUVs plan their search path to the targets autonomously by a steepest gradient descent rule. The proposed algorithm deals with various situations, such as static targets search, dynamic targets search, and one or several AUVs break down in the 3-D underwater environments with obstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of guiding multi-AUV to achieve search task of multiple targets with higher efficiency and adaptability compared with other algorithms.",4
Detecting Wash Trade in Financial Market Using Digraphs and Dynamic Programming.,"A wash trade refers to the illegal activities of traders who utilize carefully designed limit orders to manually increase the trading volumes for creating a false impression of an active market. As one of the primary formats of market abuse, a wash trade can be extremely damaging to the proper functioning and integrity of capital markets. The existing work focuses on collusive clique detections based on certain assumptions of trading behaviors. Effective approaches for analyzing and detecting wash trade in a real-life market have yet to be developed. This paper analyzes and conceptualizes the basic structures of the trading collusion in a wash trade by using a directed graph of traders. A novel method is then proposed to detect the potential wash trade activities involved in a financial instrument by first recognizing the suspiciously matched orders and then further identifying the collusions among the traders who submit such orders. Both steps are formulated as a simplified form of the knapsack problem, which can be solved by dynamic programming approaches. The proposed approach is evaluated on seven stock data sets from the NASDAQ and the London Stock Exchange. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect all primary wash trade scenarios across the selected data sets.",4
Online Learning ARMA Controllers With Guaranteed Closed-Loop Stability.,"This paper presents a novel online block adaptive learning algorithm for autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller design based on the real data measured from the plant. The method employs ARMA input-output models both for the plant and the resulting closed-loop system. In a sliding window, the plant model parameters are identified first offline using a supervised learning algorithm minimizing an epsilon -insensitive and regularized identification error, which is the window average of the distances between the measured plant output and the model output for the input provided by the controller. The optimal controller parameters are then determined again offline for another sliding window as the solution to a constrained optimization problem, where the cost is the epsilon -insensitive and regularized output tracking error and the constraints that are linear inequalities of the controller parameters are imposed for ensuring the closed-loop system to be Schur stable. Not only the identification phase but also the controller design phase uses the input-output samples measured from the plant during online learning. In the developed online controller design method, the controller parameters can always be kept in a parameter region providing Schur stability for the closed-loop system. The epsilon -insensitiveness provides robustness against disturbances, so does the regularization better generalization performance in the identification and the control. The method is tested on benchmark plants, including the inverted pendulum and dc motor models. The method is also tested on an emulated and also a real dc motor by online block adaptive learning ARMA controllers, in particular, Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers.",4
Improving on Deterministic Approximate Bayesian Inferences for Mixture Distributions.,"This paper presents the branching approach, which can improve deterministic implementation methods (such as variational Bayesian inference and expectation propagation method) for Bayesian mixture distributions. This proposed approach utilizes a set of artificial conditions defined by using the latent variables of the mixture distribution. This condition set is updated iteratively by branching based on a condition selected from the previous condition set. The target approximate Bayesian inference is obtained by merging the approximate conditional inferences under each condition in the condition set. The proposed approach is compared with several standard implementation methods by using a numerical example and a real-world example.",4
Robust Kernel Low-Rank Representation.,"Recently, low-rank representation (LRR) has shown promising performance in many real-world applications such as face clustering. However, LRR may not achieve satisfactory results when dealing with the data from nonlinear subspaces, since it is originally designed to handle the data from linear subspaces in the input space. Meanwhile, the kernel-based methods deal with the nonlinear data by mapping it from the original input space to a new feature space through a kernel-induced mapping. To effectively cope with the nonlinear data, we first propose the kernelized version of LRR in the clean data case. We also present a closed-form solution for the resultant optimization problem. Moreover, to handle corrupted data, we propose the robust kernel LRR (RKLRR) approach, and develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve it based on the alternating direction method. In particular, we show that both the subproblems in our optimization algorithm can be efficiently and exactly solved, and it is guaranteed to obtain a globally optimal solution. Besides, our proposed algorithm can also solve the original LRR problem, which is a special case of our RKLRR when using the linear kernel. In addition, based on our new optimization technique, the kernelization of some variants of LRR can be similarly achieved. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data sets and real-world data sets clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm, as well as the effectiveness of RKLRR and the kernelization of two variants of LRR.",4
A Comparison of Algorithms for Learning Hidden Variables in Bayesian Factor Graphs in Reduced Normal Form.,"Bayesian-directed acyclic discrete-variable graphs are reduced to a simplified normal form made up of only replicator units (or equal constraint units), source, and single-input/single-output blocks. In this framework, the same adaptation algorithm can be applied to all the parametric blocks. We obtain and compare adaptation rules derived from a constrained maximum likelihood formulation and a minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The learning algorithms are compared with two other updating equations based on localized decisions and on a variational approximation, respectively. The performance of the various algorithms is verified on synthetic data sets for various architectures. Factor graphs in reduced normal form provide an appealing framework for rapid deployment of Bayesian-directed graphs in the applications.",4
Efficient $\chi ^{2}$ Kernel Linearization via Random Feature Maps.,"Explicit feature mapping is an appealing way to linearize additive kernels, such as chi(2) kernel for training large-scale support vector machines (SVMs). Although accurate in approximation, feature mapping could pose computational challenges in high-dimensional settings as it expands the original features to a higher dimensional space. To handle this issue in the context of chi(2) kernel SVMs learning, we introduce a simple yet efficient method to approximately linearize chi(2) kernel through random feature maps. The main idea is to use sparse random projection to reduce the dimensionality of feature maps while preserving their approximation capability to the original kernel. We provide approximation error bound for the proposed method. Furthermore, we extend our method to chi(2) multiple kernel SVMs learning. Extensive experiments on large-scale image classification tasks confirm that the proposed approach is able to significantly speed up the training process of the chi(2) kernel SVMs at almost no cost of testing accuracy.",4
Sparse Bayesian Classification of EEG for Brain-Computer Interface.,"Regularization has been one of the most popular approaches to prevent overfitting in electroencephalogram (EEG) classification of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The effectiveness of regularization is often highly dependent on the selection of regularization parameters that are typically determined by cross-validation (CV). However, the CV imposes two main limitations on BCIs: 1) a large amount of training data is required from the user and 2) it takes a relatively long time to calibrate the classifier. These limitations substantially deteriorate the system's practicability and may cause a user to be reluctant to use BCIs. In this paper, we introduce a sparse Bayesian method by exploiting Laplace priors, namely, SBLaplace, for EEG classification. A sparse discriminant vector is learned with a Laplace prior in a hierarchical fashion under a Bayesian evidence framework. All required model parameters are automatically estimated from training data without the need of CV. Extensive comparisons are carried out between the SBLaplace algorithm and several other competing methods based on two EEG data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBLaplace algorithm achieves better overall performance than the competing algorithms for EEG classification.",4
RBoost: Label Noise-Robust Boosting Algorithm Based on a Nonconvex Loss Function and the Numerically Stable Base Learners.,"AdaBoost has attracted much attention in the machine learning community because of its excellent performance in combining weak classifiers into strong classifiers. However, AdaBoost tends to overfit to the noisy data in many applications. Accordingly, improving the antinoise ability of AdaBoost plays an important role in many applications. The sensitiveness to the noisy data of AdaBoost stems from the exponential loss function, which puts unrestricted penalties to the misclassified samples with very large margins. In this paper, we propose two boosting algorithms, referred to as RBoost1 and RBoost2, which are more robust to the noisy data compared with AdaBoost. RBoost1 and RBoost2 optimize a nonconvex loss function of the classification margin. Because the penalties to the misclassified samples are restricted to an amount less than one, RBoost1 and RBoost2 do not overfocus on the samples that are always misclassified by the previous base learners. Besides the loss function, at each boosting iteration, RBoost1 and RBoost2 use numerically stable ways to compute the base learners. These two improvements contribute to the robustness of the proposed algorithms to the noisy training and testing samples. Experimental results on the synthetic Gaussian data set, the UCI data sets, and a real malware behavior data set illustrate that the proposed RBoost1 and RBoost2 algorithms perform better when the training data sets contain noisy data.",4
Decomposition Techniques for Multilayer Perceptron Training.,"In this paper, we consider the learning problem of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) formulated as the problem of minimizing a smooth error function. As well known, the learning problem of MLPs can be a difficult nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem. Typical difficulties can be the presence of extensive flat regions and steep sided valleys in the error surface, and the possible large number of training data and of free network parameters. We define a wide class of batch learning algorithms for MLP, based on the use of block decomposition techniques in the minimization of the error function. The learning problem is decomposed into a sequence of smaller and structured minimization problems in order to advantageously exploit the structure of the objective function. Theoretical convergence results are established, and a specific algorithm is constructed and evaluated through an extensive numerical experimentation. The comparisons with the state-of-the-art learning algorithms show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",4
Estimating Sensorimotor Mapping From Stimuli to Behaviors to Infer C. elegans Movements by Neural Transmission Ability Through Connectome Databases.,"One of the ultimate goals of computational neuroscience is to quantitatively connect between complex neural circuits and behaviors. In the past decades, the touch response circuit in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has extensively been investigated in studies using genetically modified or laser-ablated worms. Synaptic connections, including chemical and electrical synapses, have been identified for most neurons in the C. elegans. However, we still do not know whether the empirically observed touch responses can be derived from connectome reconstructed from databases. To address this issue, we defined the transmission abilities (or levels) of neurons in a rate model in order to infer the behaviors of wild-type and ablated worms in response to posterior/nose/anterior touch stimuli. Our analysis showed that transmission abilities can be used to identify sensorimotor mapping from stimuli to movements and then to infer the C. elegans behaviors under simulations based on the perspective of decision-making, and provide useful information about how chemical and electronic synapses should be combined in the neural network movement analysis. This paper reveals an efficient tool that provided insights into the functions of complex neural circuits.",4
Multiple Representations-Based Face Sketch-Photo Synthesis.,"Face sketch-photo synthesis plays an important role in law enforcement and digital entertainment. Most of the existing methods only use pixel intensities as the feature. Since face images can be described using features from multiple aspects, this paper presents a novel multiple representations-based face sketch-photo-synthesis method that adaptively combines multiple representations to represent an image patch. In particular, it combines multiple features from face images processed using multiple filters and deploys Markov networks to exploit the interacting relationships between the neighboring image patches. The proposed framework could be solved using an alternating optimization strategy and it normally converges in only five outer iterations in the experiments. Our experimental results on the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) face sketch database, celebrity photos, CUHK Face Sketch FERET Database, IIIT-D Viewed Sketch Database, and forensic sketches demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for face sketch-photo synthesis. In addition, cross-database and database-dependent style-synthesis evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of this novel method and suggest promising solutions for face identification in forensic science.",4
Learning Transferred Weights From Co-Occurrence Data for Heterogeneous Transfer Learning.,"One of the main research problems in heterogeneous transfer learning is to determine whether a given source domain is effective in transferring knowledge to a target domain, and then to determine how much of the knowledge should be transferred from a source domain to a target domain. The main objective of this paper is to solve this problem by evaluating the relatedness among given domains through transferred weights. We propose a novel method to learn such transferred weights with the aid of co-occurrence data, which contain the same set of instances but in different feature spaces. Because instances with the same category should have similar features, our method is to compute their principal components in each feature space such that co-occurrence data can be rerepresented by these principal components. The principal component coefficients from different feature spaces for the same instance in the co-occurrence data have the same order of significance for describing the category information. By using these principal component coefficients, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is employed to construct a directed cyclic network where each node is a domain and each edge weight is the conditional dependence from one domain to another domain. Here, the edge weight of the network can be employed as the transferred weight from a source domain to a target domain. The weight values can be taken as a prior for setting parameters in the existing heterogeneous transfer learning methods to control the amount of knowledge transferred from a source domain to a target domain. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that can capture strong or weak relations among feature spaces, and enhance the learning performance of heterogeneous transfer learning.",4
Decentralized Dimensionality Reduction for Distributed Tensor Data Across Sensor Networks.,"This paper develops a novel decentralized dimensionality reduction algorithm for the distributed tensor data across sensor networks. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, conventional centralized methods, which utilize entire data to simultaneously determine all the vectors of the projection matrix along each tensor mode, are not suitable for the network environment. Here, we relax the simultaneous processing manner into the one-vector-by-one-vector (OVBOV) manner, i.e., determining the projection vectors (PVs) related to each tensor mode one by one. Second, we prove that in the OVBOV manner each PV can be determined without modifying any tensor data, which simplifies corresponding computations. Third, we cast the decentralized PV determination problem as a set of subproblems with consensus constraints, so that it can be solved in the network environment only by local computations and information communications among neighboring nodes. Fourth, we introduce the null space and transform the PV determination problem with complex orthogonality constraints into an equivalent hidden convex one without any orthogonality constraint, which can be solved by the Lagrange multiplier method. Finally, experimental results are given to show that the proposed algorithm is an effective dimensionality reduction scheme for the distributed tensor data across the sensor networks.",4
Synchronization Control of Neural Networks With State-Dependent Coefficient Matrices.,"This brief is concerned with synchronization control of a class of neural networks with state-dependent coefficient matrices. Being different from the existing drive-response neural networks in the literature, a novel model of drive-response neural networks is established. The concepts of uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) synchronization and convex hull Lyapunov function are introduced. Then, by using the convex hull Lyapunov function approach, the UUB synchronization design of the drive-response neural networks is proposed, and a delay-independent control law guaranteeing the bounded synchronization of the neural networks is constructed. All present conditions are formulated in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities. By comparison, it is shown that the neural networks obtained in this brief are less conservative than those ones in the literature, and the bounded synchronization is suitable for the novel drive-response neural networks. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the validity of the obtained results.",4
Learning Robust and Discriminative Subspace With Low-Rank Constraints.,"In this paper, we aim at learning robust and discriminative subspaces from noisy data. Subspace learning is widely used in extracting discriminative features for classification. However, when data are contaminated with severe noise, the performance of most existing subspace learning methods would be limited. Recent advances in low-rank modeling provide effective solutions for removing noise or outliers contained in sample sets, which motivates us to take advantage of low-rank constraints in order to exploit robust and discriminative subspace for classification. In particular, we present a discriminative subspace learning method called the supervised regularization-based robust subspace (SRRS) approach, by incorporating the low-rank constraint. SRRS seeks low-rank representations from the noisy data, and learns a discriminative subspace from the recovered clean data jointly. A supervised regularization function is designed to make use of the class label information, and therefore to enhance the discriminability of subspace. Our approach is formulated as a constrained rank-minimization problem. We design an inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier optimization algorithm to solve it. Unlike the existing sparse representation and low-rank learning methods, our approach learns a low-dimensional subspace from recovered data, and explicitly incorporates the supervised information. Our approach and some baselines are evaluated on the COIL-100, ALOI, Extended YaleB, FERET, AR, and KinFace databases. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially when the data contain considerable noise or variations.",4
A Novel Unified and Self-Stabilizing Algorithm for Generalized Eigenpairs Extraction.,"Generalized eigendecomposition problem has been widely employed in many signal processing applications. In this paper, we propose a unified and self-stabilizing algorithm, which is able to extract the first principal and minor generalized eigenvectors of a matrix pencil of two vector sequences adaptively. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithm to extract multiple generalized eigenvectors. The performance analysis shows that only the desired equilibrium point of the proposed algorithm is stable and all others are (unstable) repellers or saddle points. Convergence analysis based on the deterministic discrete-time approach shows that, for a step size within a certain range, the norm of the principal/minor state vector converges to a fixed value that relates to the corresponding principal/minor generalized eigenvalue. Thus, the proposed algorithm is a generalized eigenpairs (eigenvectors and eigenvalues) extraction algorithm. Finally, the simulation experiments are carried to further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",4
An Improved Result on Dissipativity and Passivity Analysis of Markovian Jump Stochastic Neural Networks With Two Delay Components.,"In this paper, we investigate the dissipativity and passivity of Markovian jump stochastic neural networks involving two additive time-varying delays. Using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with triple and quadruple integral terms, we obtain delay-dependent passivity and dissipativity criteria for the system. Using a generalized Finsler lemma (GFL), a set of slack variables with special structure are introduced to reduce design conservatism. The dissipativity and passivity criteria depend on the upper bounds of the discrete time-varying delay and its derivative are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be efficiently solved through the standard numerical software. Finally, our illustrative examples show that the proposed method performs well and is successful in problems where existing methods fail.",4
Evolutionary Cost-Sensitive Extreme Learning Machine.,"Conventional extreme learning machines (ELMs) solve a Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of hidden layer activated matrix and analytically determine the output weights to achieve generalized performance, by assuming the same loss from different types of misclassification. The assumption may not hold in cost-sensitive recognition tasks, such as face recognition-based access control system, where misclassifying a stranger as a family member may result in more serious disaster than misclassifying a family member as a stranger. Though recent cost-sensitive learning can reduce the total loss with a given cost matrix that quantifies how severe one type of mistake against another, in many realistic cases, the cost matrix is unknown to users. Motivated by these concerns, this paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive ELM, with the following merits: 1) to the best of our knowledge, it is the first proposal of ELM in evolutionary cost-sensitive classification scenario; 2) it well addresses the open issue of how to define the cost matrix in cost-sensitive learning tasks; and 3) an evolutionary backtracking search algorithm is induced for adaptive cost matrix optimization. Experiments in a variety of cost-sensitive tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, with about 5%-10% improvements.",4
"Mapping, Learning, Visualization, Classification, and Understanding of fMRI Data in the NeuCube Evolving Spatiotemporal Data Machine of Spiking Neural Networks.","This paper introduces a new methodology for dynamic learning, visualization, and classification of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as spatiotemporal brain data. The method is based on an evolving spatiotemporal data machine of evolving spiking neural networks (SNNs) exemplified by the NeuCube architecture [1]. The method consists of several steps: mapping spatial coordinates of fMRI data into a 3-D SNN cube (SNNc) that represents a brain template; input data transformation into trains of spikes; deep, unsupervised learning in the 3-D SNNc of spatiotemporal patterns from data; supervised learning in an evolving SNN classifier; parameter optimization; and 3-D visualization and model interpretation. Two benchmark case study problems and data are used to illustrate the proposed methodology-fMRI data collected from subjects when reading affirmative or negative sentences and another one-on reading a sentence or seeing a picture. The learned connections in the SNNc represent dynamic spatiotemporal relationships derived from the fMRI data. They can reveal new information about the brain functions under different conditions. The proposed methodology allows for the first time to analyze dynamic functional and structural connectivity of a learned SNN model from fMRI data. This can be used for a better understanding of brain activities and also for online generation of appropriate neurofeedback to subjects for improved brain functions. For example, in this paper, tracing the 3-D SNN model connectivity enabled us for the first time to capture prominent brain functional pathways evoked in language comprehension. We found stronger spatiotemporal interaction between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left temporal while reading a negated sentence. This observation is obviously distinguishable from the patterns generated by either reading affirmative sentences or seeing pictures. The proposed NeuCube-based methodology offers also a superior classification accuracy when compared with traditional AI and statistical methods. The created NeuCube-based models of fMRI data are directly and efficiently implementable on high performance and low energy consumption neuromorphic platforms for real-time applications.",4
Connections Between Nuclear-Norm and Frobenius-Norm-Based Representations.,"A lot of works have shown that frobenius-norm-based representation (FNR) is competitive to sparse representation and nuclear-norm-based representation (NNR) in numerous tasks such as subspace clustering. Despite the success of FNR in experimental studies, less theoretical analysis is provided to understand its working mechanism. In this brief, we fill this gap by building the theoretical connections between FNR and NNR. More specially, we prove that: 1) when the dictionary can provide enough representative capacity, FNR is exactly NNR even though the data set contains the Gaussian noise, Laplacian noise, or sample-specified corruption and 2) otherwise, FNR and NNR are two solutions on the column space of the dictionary.",4
The Twist Tensor Nuclear Norm for Video Completion.,"In this paper, we propose a new low-rank tensor model based on the circulant algebra, namely, twist tensor nuclear norm (t-TNN). The twist tensor denotes a three-way tensor representation to laterally store 2-D data slices in order. On one hand, t-TNN convexly relaxes the tensor multirank of the twist tensor in the Fourier domain, which allows an efficient computation using fast Fourier transform. On the other, t-TNN is equal to the nuclear norm of block circulant matricization of the twist tensor in the original domain, which extends the traditional matrix nuclear norm in a block circulant way. We test the t-TNN model on a video completion application that aims to fill missing values and the experiment results validate its effectiveness, especially when dealing with video recorded by a nonstationary panning camera. The block circulant matricization of the twist tensor can be transformed into a circulant block representation with nuclear norm invariance. This representation, after transformation, exploits the horizontal translation relationship between the frames in a video, and endows the t-TNN model with a more powerful ability to reconstruct panning videos than the existing state-of-the-art low-rank models.",4
Delay-Dependent Global Exponential Stability for Delayed Recurrent Neural Networks.,"This paper deals with the global exponential stability for delayed recurrent neural networks (DRNNs). By constructing an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and adopting the reciprocally convex combination approach and Wirtinger-based integral inequality, delay-dependent global exponential stability criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Meanwhile, a general and effective method on global exponential stability analysis for DRNNs is given through a lemma, where the exponential convergence rate can be estimated. With this lemma, some global asymptotic stability criteria of DRNNs acquired in previous studies can be generalized to global exponential stability ones. Finally, a frequently utilized numerical example is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed theoretical results.",4
Model-Driven Analysis of Eyeblink Classical Conditioning Reveals the Underlying Structure of Cerebellar Plasticity and Neuronal Activity.,"The cerebellum plays a critical role in sensorimotor control. However, how the specific circuits and plastic mechanisms of the cerebellum are engaged in closed-loop processing is still unclear. We developed an artificial sensorimotor control system embedding a detailed spiking cerebellar microcircuit with three bidirectional plasticity sites. This proved able to reproduce a cerebellar-driven associative paradigm, the eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC), in which a precise time relationship between an unconditioned stimulus (US) and a conditioned stimulus (CS) is established. We challenged the spiking model to fit an experimental data set from human subjects. Two subsequent sessions of EBCC acquisition and extinction were recorded and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied on the cerebellum to alter circuit function and plasticity. Evolutionary algorithms were used to find the near-optimal model parameters to reproduce the behaviors of subjects in the different sessions of the protocol. The main finding is that the optimized cerebellar model was able to learn to anticipate (predict) conditioned responses with accurate timing and success rate, demonstrating fast acquisition, memory stabilization, rapid extinction, and faster reacquisition as in EBCC in humans. The firing of Purkinje cells (PCs) and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) changed during learning under the control of synaptic plasticity, which evolved at different rates, with a faster acquisition in the cerebellar cortex than in DCN synapses. Eventually, a reduced PC activity released DCN discharge just after the CS, precisely anticipating the US and causing the eyeblink. Moreover, a specific alteration in cortical plasticity explained the EBCC changes induced by cerebellar TMS in humans. In this paper, for the first time, it is shown how closed-loop simulations, using detailed cerebellar microcircuit models, can be successfully used to fit real experimental data sets. Thus, the changes of the model parameters in the different sessions of the protocol unveil how implicit microcircuit mechanisms can generate normal and altered associative behaviors.The cerebellum plays a critical role in sensorimotor control.

Evaluating the Visualization of What a Deep Neural Network Has Learned.,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in complex machine learning tasks such as image classification or speech recognition. However, due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent, i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision, given a new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the ""importance"" of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper, we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications. Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps for unsupervised assessment of the neural network performance.Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in complex machine learning tasks such as image classification or speech recognition.

Adaptive Neural Networks Decentralized FTC Design for Nonstrict-Feedback Nonlinear Interconnected Large-Scale Systems Against Actuator Faults.,"The problem of active fault-tolerant control (FTC) is investigated for the large-scale nonlinear systems in nonstrict-feedback form. The nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems considered in this paper consist of unstructured uncertainties, unmeasured states, unknown interconnected terms, and actuator faults (e.g., bias fault and gain fault). A state observer is designed to solve the unmeasurable state problem. Neural networks (NNs) are used to identify the unknown lumped nonlinear functions so that the problems of unstructured uncertainties and unknown interconnected terms can be solved. By combining the adaptive backstepping design principle with the combination Nussbaum gain function property, a novel NN adaptive output-feedback FTC approach is developed. The proposed FTC controller can guarantee that all signals in all subsystems are bounded, and the tracking errors for each subsystem converge to a small neighborhood of zero.

Lower Bounds on the Proportion of Leaders Needed for Expected Consensus of 3-D Flocks.,"This paper considers the consensus behavior of a spatially distributed 3-D dynamical network composed of heterogeneous agents: leaders and followers, in which the leaders have the preferred information about the destination, while the followers do not have. All followers move in a 3-D Euclidean space with a given speed and with their headings updated according to the average velocity of the corresponding neighbors. Compared with the 2-D model, a key point lies in how to analyze the dynamical behavior of a ""linear"" nonhomogeneous equation where the nonhomogeneous term strongly nonlinearly depends on the states of all agents. Using the network structure and the estimation of some characteristics for the initial states, we present a proper decaying rate for the nonhomogeneous term and then establish lower bounds on the ratio of the number of leaders to the number of followers that is needed for the expected consensus by considering two cases: 1) fixed speed and neighborhood radius and 2) variable speed and neighborhood radius with respect to the population size.

A Squeezed Artificial Neural Network for the Symbolic Network Reliability Functions of Binary-State Networks.,"Network reliability is an important index to the provision of useful information for decision support in the modern world. There is always a need to calculate symbolic network reliability functions (SNRFs) due to dynamic and rapid changes in network parameters. In this brief, the proposed squeezed artificial neural network (SqANN) approach uses the Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the corresponding reliability of a given designed matrix from the Box-Behnken design, and then the Taguchi method is implemented to find the appropriate number of neurons and activation functions of the hidden layer and the output layer in ANN to evaluate SNRFs. According to the experimental results of the benchmark networks, the comparison appears to support the superiority of the proposed SqANN method over the traditional ANN-based approach with at least 16.6% improvement in the median absolute deviation in the cost of extra 2 s on average for all experiments.Network reliability is an important index to the provision of useful information for decision support in the modern world.

Sampled-Data Consensus of Linear Multi-agent Systems With Packet Losses.,"In this paper, the consensus problem is studied for a class of multi-agent systems with sampled data and packet losses, where random and deterministic packet losses are considered, respectively. For random packet losses, a Bernoulli-distributed white sequence is used to describe packet dropouts among agents in a stochastic way. For deterministic packet losses, a switched system with stable and unstable subsystems is employed to model packet dropouts in a deterministic way. The purpose of this paper is to derive consensus criteria, such that linear multi-agent systems with sampled-data and packet losses can reach consensus. By means of the Lyapunov function approach and the decomposition method, the design problem of a distributed controller is solved in terms of convex optimization. The interplay among the allowable bound of the sampling interval, the probability of random packet losses, and the rate of deterministic packet losses are explicitly derived to characterize consensus conditions. The obtained criteria are closely related to the maximum eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix versus the second minimum eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, which reveals the intrinsic effect of communication topologies on consensus performance.

Pair- ${v}$ -SVR: A Novel and Efficient Pairing nu-Support Vector Regression Algorithm.,"This paper proposes a novel and efficient pairing nu-support vector regression (pair--SVR) algorithm that combines successfully the superior advantages of twin support vector regression (TSVR) and classical -SVR algorithms. In spirit of TSVR, the proposed pair--SVR solves two quadratic programming problems (QPPs) of smaller size rather than a single larger QPP, and thus has faster learning speed than classical -SVR. The significant advantage of our pair--SVR over TSVR is the improvement in the prediction speed and generalization ability by introducing the concepts of the insensitive zone and the regularization term that embodies the essence of statistical learning theory. Moreover, pair--SVR has additional advantage of using parameter for controlling the bounds on fractions of SVs and errors. Furthermore, the upper bound and lower bound functions of the regression model estimated by pair--SVR capture well the characteristics of data distributions, thus facilitating automatic estimation of the conditional mean and predictive variance simultaneously. This may be useful in many cases, especially when the noise is heteroscedastic and depends strongly on the input values.

LMI Conditions for Global Stability of Fractional-Order Neural Networks.,"Fractional-order neural networks play a vital role in modeling the information processing of neuronal interactions. It is still an open and necessary topic for fractional-order neural networks to investigate their global stability. This paper proposes some simplified linear matrix inequality (LMI) stability conditions for fractional-order linear and nonlinear systems.

Moreover, a generalized projective synchronization method between such neural systems is given, along with its corresponding LMI condition. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the established LMI conditions.",4
Randomized Prediction Games for Adversarial Machine Learning.,"In spam and malware detection, attackers exploit randomization to obfuscate malicious data and increase their chances of evading detection at test time, e.g., malware code is typically obfuscated using random strings or byte sequences to hide known exploits. Interestingly, randomization has also been proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker. Recent work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers, by simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function accordingly. However, both the classification function and the simulated data manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner, without accounting for any form of randomization. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing a randomized prediction game, namely, a noncooperative game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution defined over the respective strategy set. We show that our approach allows one to improve the tradeoff between attack detection and false alarms with respect to the state-of-the-art secure classifiers, even against attacks that are different from those hypothesized during design, on application examples including handwritten digit recognition, spam, and malware detection.In spam and malware detection, attackers exploit randomization to obfuscate malicious data and increase their chances of evading detection at test time, e.g., malware code is typically obfuscated using random strings or byte sequences to hide known exploits.

Hierarchical Address Event Routing for Reconfigurable Large-Scale Neuromorphic Systems.,"We present a hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) architecture for scalable communication of neural and synaptic spike events between neuromorphic processors, implemented with five Xilinx Spartan-6 field-programmable gate arrays and four custom analog neuromophic integrated circuits serving 262k neurons and 262M synapses. The architecture extends the single-bus address-event representation protocol to a hierarchy of multiple nested buses, routing events across increasing scales of spatial distance. The HiAER protocol provides individually programmable axonal delay in addition to strength for each synapse, lending itself toward biologically plausible neural network architectures, and scales across a range of hierarchies suitable for multichip and multiboard systems in reconfigurable large-scale neuromorphic systems. We show approximately linear scaling of net global synaptic event throughput with number of routing nodes in the network, at 3.6x10(7) synaptic events per second per 16k-neuron node in the hierarchy.",4
A Binaural Neuromorphic Auditory Sensor for FPGA: A Spike Signal Processing Approach.,"This paper presents a new architecture, design flow, and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation analysis of a neuromorphic binaural auditory sensor, designed completely in the spike domain. Unlike digital cochleae that decompose audio signals using classical digital signal processing techniques, the model presented in this paper processes information directly encoded as spikes using pulse frequency modulation and provides a set of frequency-decomposed audio information using an address-event representation interface. In this case, a systematic approach to design led to a generic process for building, tuning, and implementing audio frequency decomposers with different features, facilitating synthesis with custom features. This allows researchers to implement their own parameterized neuromorphic auditory systems in a low-cost FPGA in order to study the audio processing and learning activity that takes place in the brain. In this paper, we present a 64-channel binaural neuromorphic auditory system implemented in a Virtex-5 FPGA using a commercial development board. The system was excited with a diverse set of audio signals in order to analyze its response and characterize its features. The neuromorphic auditory system response times and frequencies are reported. The experimental results of the proposed system implementation with 64-channel stereo are: a frequency range between 9.6 Hz and 14.6 kHz (adjustable), a maximum output event rate of 2.19 Mevents/s, a power consumption of 29.7 mW, the slices requirements of 11141, and a system clock frequency of 27 MHz.",4
Lagrange Programming Neural Network for Nondifferentiable Optimization Problems in Sparse Approximation.,"The major limitation of the Lagrange programming neural network (LPNN) approach is that the objective function and the constraints should be twice differentiable. Since sparse approximation involves nondifferentiable functions, the original LPNN approach is not suitable for recovering sparse signals. This paper proposes a new formulation of the LPNN approach based on the concept of the locally competitive algorithm (LCA). Unlike the classical LCA approach which is able to solve unconstrained optimization problems only, the proposed LPNN approach is able to solve the constrained optimization problems. Two problems in sparse approximation are considered. They are basis pursuit (BP) and constrained BP denoise (CBPDN). We propose two LPNN models, namely, BP-LPNN and CBPDN-LPNN, to solve these two problems. For these two models, we show that the equilibrium points of the models are the optimal solutions of the two problems, and that the optimal solutions of the two problems are the equilibrium points of the two models. Besides, the equilibrium points are stable. Simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of these two LPNN models.",4
A Biologically Inspired Appearance Model for Robust Visual Tracking.,"In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired appearance model for robust visual tracking. Motivated in part by the success of the hierarchical organization of the primary visual cortex (area V1), we establish an architecture consisting of five layers: whitening, rectification, normalization, coding, and pooling. The first three layers stem from the models developed for object recognition. In this paper, our attention focuses on the coding and pooling layers. In particular, we use a discriminative sparse coding method in the coding layer along with spatial pyramid representation in the pooling layer, which makes it easier to distinguish the target to be tracked from its background in the presence of appearance variations. An extensive experimental study shows that the proposed method has higher tracking accuracy than several state-of-the-art trackers.",4
Off-Policy Integral Reinforcement Learning Method to Solve Nonlinear Continuous-Time Multiplayer Nonzero-Sum Games.,This paper establishes an off-policy integral reinforcement learning (IRL) method to solve nonlinear continuous-time (CT) nonzero-sum (NZS) games with unknown system dynamics. The IRL algorithm is presented to obtain the iterative control and off-policy learning is used to allow the dynamics to be completely unknown. Off-policy IRL is designed to do policy evaluation and policy improvement in the policy iteration algorithm. Critic and action networks are used to obtain the performance index and control for each player. The gradient descent algorithm makes the update of critic and action weights simultaneously. The convergence analysis of the weights is given. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and the existence of Nash equilibrium are proved. The simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed method for nonlinear CT NZS games with unknown system dynamics.,4
Event-Based $H_\infty $ State Estimation for Time-Varying Stochastic Dynamical Networks With State- and Disturbance-Dependent Noises.,"In this paper, the event-based finite-horizon Hinfinity state estimation problem is investigated for a class of discrete time-varying stochastic dynamical networks with state- and disturbance-dependent noises [also called (x,v) -dependent noises]. An event-triggered scheme is proposed to decrease the frequency of the data transmission between the sensors and the estimator, where the signal is transmitted only when certain conditions are satisfied. The purpose of the problem addressed is to design a time-varying state estimator in order to estimate the network states through available output measurements. By employing the completing-the-square technique and the stochastic analysis approach, sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the error dynamics of the state estimation satisfies a prescribed Hinfinity performance constraint over a finite horizon. The desired estimator parameters can be designed via solving coupled backward recursive Riccati difference equations. Finally, a numerical example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed state estimation scheme.",4
Stability of Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay via Flexible Terminal Method.,"This brief is concerned with the stability criteria for recurrent neural networks with time-varying delay. First, based on convex combination technique, a delay interval with fixed terminals is changed into the one with flexible terminals, which is called flexible terminal method (FTM). Second, based on the FTM, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed, in which the integral interval associated with delayed variables is not fixed. Thus, the FTM can achieve the same effect as that of delay-partitioning method, while their implementary ways are different. Guided by FTM, Wirtinger-based integral inequality and free-weight matrix method are employed to develop several stability criteria, respectively. Finally, the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed results are tested by two numerical examples.",4
Optimized Structure of the Traffic Flow Forecasting Model With a Deep Learning Approach.,"Forecasting accuracy is an important issue for successful intelligent traffic management, especially in the domain of traffic efficiency and congestion reduction. The dawning of the big data era brings opportunities to greatly improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel model, stacked autoencoder Levenberg-Marquardt model, which is a type of deep architecture of neural network approach aiming to improve forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is designed using the Taguchi method to develop an optimized structure and to learn traffic flow features through layer-by-layer feature granulation with a greedy layerwise unsupervised learning algorithm. It is applied to real-world data collected from the M6 freeway in the U.K. and is compared with three existing traffic predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an optimized structure of the traffic flow forecasting model with a deep learning approach is presented. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model with an optimized structure has superior performance in traffic flow forecasting.",4
Fractional Hopfield Neural Networks: Fractional Dynamic Associative Recurrent Neural Networks.,"This paper mainly discusses a novel conceptual framework: fractional Hopfield neural networks (FHNN). As is commonly known, fractional calculus has been incorporated into artificial neural networks, mainly because of its long-term memory and nonlocality. Some researchers have made interesting attempts at fractional neural networks and gained competitive advantages over integer-order neural networks. Therefore, it is naturally makes one ponder how to generalize the first-order Hopfield neural networks to the fractional-order ones, and how to implement FHNN by means of fractional calculus. We propose to introduce a novel mathematical method: fractional calculus to implement FHNN. First, we implement fractor in the form of an analog circuit. Second, we implement FHNN by utilizing fractor and the fractional steepest descent approach, construct its Lyapunov function, and further analyze its attractors. Third, we perform experiments to analyze the stability and convergence of FHNN, and further discuss its applications to the defense against chip cloning attacks for anticounterfeiting. The main contribution of our work is to propose FHNN in the form of an analog circuit by utilizing a fractor and the fractional steepest descent approach, construct its Lyapunov function, prove its Lyapunov stability, analyze its attractors, and apply FHNN to the defense against chip cloning attacks for anticounterfeiting. A significant advantage of FHNN is that its attractors essentially relate to the neuron's fractional order. FHNN possesses the fractional-order-stability and fractional-order-sensitivity characteristics.",4
A Collective Neurodynamic Optimization Approach to Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.,"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is an advanced method for nonnegative feature extraction, with widespread applications. However, the NMF solution often entails to solve a global optimization problem with a nonconvex objective function and nonnegativity constraints. This paper presents a collective neurodynamic optimization (CNO) approach to this challenging problem. The proposed collective neurodynamic system consists of a population of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) at the lower level and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with wavelet mutation at the upper level. The RNNs act as search agents carrying out precise local searches according to their neurodynamics and initial conditions. The PSO algorithm coordinates and guides the RNNs with updated initial states toward global optimal solution(s). A wavelet mutation operator is added to enhance PSO exploration diversity. Through iterative interaction and improvement of the locally best solutions of RNNs and global best positions of the whole population, the population-based neurodynamic systems are almost sure able to achieve the global optimality for the NMF problem. It is proved that the convergence of the group-best state to the global optimal solution with probability one. The experimental results substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the CNO approach to bound-constrained global optimization with several benchmark nonconvex functions and NMF-based clustering with benchmark data sets in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",4
Synchronization of Switched Neural Networks With Communication Delays via the Event-Triggered Control.,"This paper addresses the issue of synchronization of switched delayed neural networks with communication delays via event-triggered control. For synchronizing coupled switched neural networks, we propose a novel event-triggered control law which could greatly reduce the number of control updates for synchronization tasks of coupled switched neural networks involving embedded microprocessors with limited on-board resources. The control signals are driven by properly defined events, which depend on the measurement errors and current-sampled states. By using a delay system method, a novel model of synchronization error system with delays is proposed with the communication delays and event-triggered control in the unified framework for coupled switched neural networks. The criteria are derived for the event-triggered synchronization analysis and control synthesis of switched neural networks via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and free weighting matrix approach. A numerical example is elaborated on to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived results.",4
Model-Free Optimal Tracking Control via Critic-Only Q-Learning.,"Model-free control is an important and promising topic in control fields, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. In this paper, we aim to solve the model-free optimal tracking control problem of nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems. A critic-only Q-learning (CoQL) method is developed, which learns the optimal tracking control from real system data, and thus avoids solving the tracking Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. First, the Q-learning algorithm is proposed based on the augmented system, and its convergence is established. Using only one neural network for approximating the Q-function, the CoQL method is developed to implement the Q-learning algorithm. Furthermore, the convergence of the CoQL method is proved with the consideration of neural network approximation error. With the convergent Q-function obtained from the CoQL method, the adaptive optimal tracking control is designed based on the gradient descent scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed CoQL method is demonstrated through simulation studies. The developed CoQL method learns with off-policy data and implements with a critic-only structure, thus it is easy to realize and overcome the inadequate exploration problem.",4
A New Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Control Framework Based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming.,"This brief presents a novel application of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) for optimal adaptive control of powered lower limb prostheses, a type of wearable robots to assist the motor function of the limb amputees. Current control of these robotic devices typically relies on finite state impedance control (FS-IC), which lacks adaptability to the user's physical condition. As a result, joint impedance settings are often customized manually and heuristically in clinics, which greatly hinder the wide use of these advanced medical devices. This simulation study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of ADP for automatic tuning of the twelve knee joint impedance parameters during a complete gait cycle to achieve balanced walking. Given that the accurate models of human walking dynamics are difficult to obtain, the model-free ADP control algorithms were considered. First, direct heuristic dynamic programming (dHDP) was applied to the control problem, and its performance was evaluated on OpenSim, an often-used dynamic walking simulator. For the comparison purposes, we selected another established ADP algorithm, the neural fitted Q with continuous action (NFQCA). In both cases, the ADP controllers learned to control the right knee joint and achieved balanced walking, but dHDP outperformed NFQCA in this application during a 200 gait cycle-based testing.",4
Multiobjective Deep Belief Networks Ensemble for Remaining Useful Life Estimation in Prognostics.,"In numerous industrial applications where safety, efficiency, and reliability are among primary concerns, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is often the most effective and reliable maintenance policy. Prognostics, as one of the key enablers of CBM, involves the core task of estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of the system. Neural networks-based approaches have produced promising results on RUL estimation, although their performances are influenced by handcrafted features and manually specified parameters. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective deep belief networks ensemble (MODBNE) method. MODBNE employs a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm integrated with the traditional DBN training technique to evolve multiple DBNs simultaneously subject to accuracy and diversity as two conflicting objectives. The eventually evolved DBNs are combined to establish an ensemble model used for RUL estimation, where combination weights are optimized via a single-objective differential evolution algorithm using a task-oriented objective function. We evaluate the proposed method on several prognostic benchmarking data sets and also compare it with some existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.",4
LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey.,"Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ( approximately 15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.",4
Semisupervised Feature Analysis by Mining Correlations Among Multiple Tasks.,"In this paper, we propose a novel semisupervised feature selection framework by mining correlations among multiple tasks and apply it to different multimedia applications. Instead of independently computing the importance of features for each task, our algorithm leverages shared knowledge from multiple related tasks, thus improving the performance of feature selection. Note that the proposed algorithm is built upon an assumption that different tasks share some common structures. The proposed algorithm selects features in a batch mode, by which the correlations between various features are taken into consideration. Besides, considering the fact that labeling a large amount of training data in real world is both time-consuming and tedious, we adopt manifold learning, which exploits both labeled and unlabeled training data for a feature space analysis. Since the objective function is nonsmooth and difficult to solve, we propose an iteractive algorithm with fast convergence. Extensive experiments on different applications demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the other state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.",4
An Online Unsupervised Structural Plasticity Algorithm for Spiking Neural Networks.,"In this paper, we propose a novel winner-take-all (WTA) architecture employing neurons with nonlinear dendrites and an online unsupervised structural plasticity rule for training it. Furthermore, to aid hardware implementations, our network employs only binary synapses. The proposed learning rule is inspired by spike-timing-dependent plasticity but differs for each dendrite based on its activation level. It trains the WTA network through formation and elimination of connections between inputs and synapses. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed network and learning rule, we employ it to solve two-class, four-class, and six-class classification of random Poisson spike time inputs. The results indicate that by proper tuning of the inhibitory time constant of the WTA, a tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity of the network can be achieved. We use the inhibitory time constant to set the number of subpatterns per pattern we want to detect. We show that while the percentages of successful trials are 92%, 88%, and 82% for two-class, four-class, and six-class classification when no pattern subdivisions are made, it increases to 100% when each pattern is subdivided into 5 or 10 subpatterns. However, the former scenario of no pattern subdivision is more jitter resilient than the later ones.",4
Resolution of Singularities Introduced by Hierarchical Structure in Deep Neural Networks.,"We present a theoretical analysis of singular points of artificial deep neural networks, resulting in providing deep neural network models having no critical points introduced by a hierarchical structure. It is considered that such deep neural network models have good nature for gradient-based optimization. First, we show that there exist a large number of critical points introduced by a hierarchical structure in deep neural networks as straight lines, depending on the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden neurons. Second, we derive a sufficient condition for deep neural networks having no critical points introduced by a hierarchical structure, which can be applied to general deep neural networks. It is also shown that the existence of critical points introduced by a hierarchical structure is determined by the rank and the regularity of weight matrices for a specific class of deep neural networks. Finally, two kinds of implementation methods of the sufficient conditions to have no critical points are provided. One is a learning algorithm that can avoid critical points introduced by the hierarchical structure during learning (called avoidant learning algorithm). The other is a neural network that does not have some critical points introduced by the hierarchical structure as an inherent property (called avoidant neural network).",4
Improving Neural-Network Classifiers Using Nearest Neighbor Partitioning.,"This paper presents a nearest neighbor partitioning method designed to improve the performance of a neural-network classifier. For neural-network classifiers, usually the number, positions, and labels of centroids are fixed in partition space before training. However, that approach limits the search for potential neural networks during optimization; the quality of a neural network classifier is based on how clear the decision boundaries are between classes. Although attempts have been made to generate floating centroids automatically, these methods still tend to generate sphere-like partitions and cannot produce flexible decision boundaries. We propose the use of nearest neighbor classification in conjunction with a neural-network classifier. Instead of being bound by sphere-like boundaries (such as the case with centroid-based methods), the flexibility of nearest neighbors increases the chance of finding potential neural networks that have arbitrarily shaped boundaries in partition space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance on accuracy and average f-measure.",4
Methodology of Recurrent Laguerre-Volterra Network for Modeling Nonlinear Dynamic Systems.,"In this paper, we have introduced a general modeling approach for dynamic nonlinear systems that utilizes a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm for training the Laguerre-Volterra network (LVN) to overcome the local minima and convergence problems and employs a pruning technique to achieve sparse LVN representations with l1 regularization. We tested this new approach with computer simulated systems and extended it to autoregressive sparse LVN (ASLVN) model structures that are suitable for input-output modeling of nonlinear systems that exhibit transitions in dynamic states, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) equations of neuronal firing. Application of the proposed ASLVN to the H-H equations yields a more parsimonious input-output model with improved predictive capability that is amenable to more insightful physiological/biological interpretation.",4
A New Discriminative Sparse Representation Method for Robust Face Recognition via l(2) Regularization.,"Sparse representation has shown an attractive performance in a number of applications. However, the available sparse representation methods still suffer from some problems, and it is necessary to design more efficient methods. Particularly, to design a computationally inexpensive, easily solvable, and robust sparse representation method is a significant task. In this paper, we explore the issue of designing the simple, robust, and powerfully efficient sparse representation methods for image classification. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a novel discriminative sparse representation method is proposed and its noticeable performance in image classification is demonstrated by the experimental results. More importantly, the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art sparse representation methods. Second, the proposed method is not only very computationally efficient but also has an intuitive and easily understandable idea. It exploits a simple algorithm to obtain a closed-form solution and discriminative representation of the test sample. Third, the feasibility, computational efficiency, and remarkable classification accuracy of the proposed l(2) regularization-based representation are comprehensively shown by extensive experiments and analysis. The code of the proposed method is available at http://www.yongxu.org/lunwen.html.",4
Smooth Neuroadaptive PI Tracking Control of Nonlinear Systems With Unknown and Nonsmooth Actuation Characteristics.,"This paper considers the tracking control problem for a class of multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems subject to unknown actuation characteristics and external disturbances. Neuroadaptive proportional-integral (PI) control with self-tuning gains is proposed, which is structurally simple and computationally inexpensive. Different from traditional PI control, the proposed one is able to online adjust its PI gains using stability-guaranteed analytic algorithms without involving manual tuning or trial and error process. It is shown that the proposed neuroadaptive PI control is continuous and smooth everywhere and ensures the uniformly ultimately boundedness of all the signals of the closed-loop system. Furthermore, the crucial compact set precondition for a neural network (NN) to function properly is guaranteed with the barrier Lyapunov function, allowing the NN unit to play its learning/approximating role during the entire system operation. The salient feature also lies in its low complexity in computation and effectiveness in dealing with modeling uncertainties and nonlinearities. Both square and nonsquare nonlinear systems are addressed. The benefits and the feasibility of the developed control are also confirmed by simulations.",4
Kinematic Control of Redundant Manipulators Using Neural Networks.,"Redundancy resolution is a critical problem in the control of robotic manipulators. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), as inherently parallel processing models for time-sequence processing, are potentially applicable for the motion control of manipulators. However, the development of neural models for high-accuracy and real-time control is a challenging problem. This paper identifies two limitations of the existing RNN solutions for manipulator control, i.e., position error accumulation and the convex restriction on the projection set, and overcomes them by proposing two modified neural network models. Our method allows nonconvex sets for projection operations, and control error does not accumulate over time in the presence of noise. Unlike most works in which RNNs are used to process time sequences, the proposed approach is model-based and training-free, which makes it possible to achieve fast tracking of reference signals with superior robustness and accuracy. Theoretical analysis reveals the global stability of a system under the control of the proposed neural networks. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method in both the position regulation and tracking control of redundant PUMA 560 manipulators.",4
Predictor-Based Neural Dynamic Surface Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems in Strict-Feedback Form.,"This paper presents a predictor-based neural dynamic surface control (PNDSC) design method for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems in a strict-feedback form. In contrast to existing NDSC approaches where the tracking errors are commonly used to update neural network weights, a predictor is proposed for every subsystem, and the prediction errors are employed to update the neural adaptation laws. The proposed scheme enables smooth and fast identification of system dynamics without incurring high-frequency oscillations, which are unavoidable using classical NDSC methods. Furthermore, the result is extended to the PNDSC with observer feedback, and its robustness against measurement noise is analyzed. Numerical and experimental results are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed PNDSC architecture.",4
Containment Control for Second-Order Multiagent Systems Communicating Over Heterogeneous Networks.,"The containment control is studied for the second-order multiagent systems over a heterogeneous network where the position and velocity interactions are different. We consider three cases that multiple leaders are stationary, moving at the same constant speed, and moving at the same time-varying speed, and develop different containment control algorithms for each case. In particular, for the former two cases, we first propose the containment algorithms based on the well-established ones for the homogeneous network, for which the position interaction topology is required to be undirected. Then, we extend the results to the general setting with the directed position and velocity interaction topologies by developing a novel algorithm. For the last case with time-varying velocities, we introduce two algorithms to address the containment control problem under, respectively, the directed and undirected interaction topologies. For most cases, sufficient conditions with regard to the interaction topologies are derived for guaranteeing the containment behavior and, thus, are easy to verify. Finally, six simulation examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the theoretical findings.",4
Large-Cone Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.,"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been greatly popularized by its parts-based interpretation and the effective multiplicative updating rule for searching local solutions. In this paper, we study the problem of how to obtain an attractive local solution for NMF, which not only fits the given training data well but also generalizes well on the unseen test data. Based on the geometric interpretation of NMF, we introduce two large-cone penalties for NMF and propose large-cone NMF (LCNMF) algorithms. Compared with NMF, LCNMF will obtain bases comprising a larger simplicial cone, and therefore has three advantages. 1) the empirical reconstruction error of LCNMF could mostly be smaller; (2) the generalization ability of the proposed algorithm is much more powerful; and (3) the obtained bases of LCNMF have a low-overlapping property, which enables the bases to be sparse and makes the proposed algorithms very robust. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets confirm the efficiency of LCNMF.",4
Online Regression for Data With Changepoints Using Gaussian Processes and Reusable Models.,"Many prediction, decision-making, and control architectures rely on online learned Gaussian process (GP) models. However, most existing GP regression algorithms assume a single generative model, leading to poor predictive performance when the data are nonstationary, i.e., generated from multiple switching processes. Furthermore, existing methods for GP regression over nonstationary data require significant computation, do not come with provable guarantees on correctness and speed, and many only work in batch settings, making them ill-suited for real-time prediction. We present an efficient online GP framework, GP-non-Bayesian clustering (GP-NBC), which addresses these computational and theoretical issues, allowing for real-time changepoint detection and regression using GPs. Our empirical results on two real-world data sets and two synthetic data set show that GP-NBC outperforms state-of-the-art methods for nonstationary regression in terms of both regression error and computation. For example, it outperforms Dirichlet process GP clustering with Gibbs sampling by 98% in computation time reduction while the mean absolute error is comparable.",4
Budget Online Learning Algorithm for Least Squares SVM.,"Batch-mode least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is often associated with unbounded number of support vectors (SVs'), making it unsuitable for applications involving large-scale streaming data. Limited-scale LSSVM, which allows efficient updating, seems to be a good solution to tackle this issue. In this paper, to train the limited-scale LSSVM dynamically, we present a budget online LSSVM (BOLSSVM) algorithm. Methodologically, by setting a fixed budget for SVs', we are able to update the LSSVM model according to the updated SVs' set dynamically without retraining from scratch. In particular, when a new small chunk of SVs' substitute for the old ones, the proposed algorithm employs a low rank correction technology and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula to compute the inverse of saddle point matrix derived from the LSSVM's Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system, which, in turn, updates the LSSVM model efficiently. In this way, the proposed BOLSSVM algorithm is especially useful for online prediction tasks. Another merit of the proposed BOLSSVM is that it can be used for k -fold cross validation. Specifically, compared with batch-mode learning methods, the computational complexity of the proposed BOLSSVM method is significantly reduced from O(n(4)) to O(n(3)) for leave-one-out cross validation with n training samples. The experimental results of classification and regression on benchmark data sets and real-world applications show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed BOLSSVM algorithm.",4
Neural Network-Based Passive Filtering for Delayed Neutral-Type Semi-Markovian Jump Systems.,"This paper investigates the problem of exponential passive filtering for a class of stochastic neutral-type neural networks with both semi-Markovian jump parameters and mixed time delays. Our aim is to estimate the states by designing a Luenberger-type observer, such that the filter error dynamics are mean-square exponentially stable with an expected decay rate and an attenuation level. Sufficient conditions for the existence of passive filters are obtained, and a convex optimization algorithm for the filter design is given. In addition, a cone complementarity linearization procedure is employed to cast the nonconvex feasibility problem into a sequential minimization problem, which can be readily solved by the existing optimization techniques. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",4
A Novel Neural Network for Generally Constrained Variational Inequalities.,"This paper presents a novel neural network for solving generally constrained variational inequality problems by constructing a system of double projection equations. By defining proper convex energy functions, the proposed neural network is proved to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and converges to an exact solution of the original problem for any starting point under the weaker cocoercivity condition or the monotonicity condition of the gradient mapping on the linear equation set. Furthermore, two sufficient conditions are provided to ensure the stability of the proposed neural network for a special case. The proposed model overcomes some shortcomings of existing continuous-time neural networks for constrained variational inequality, and its stability only requires some monotonicity conditions of the underlying mapping and the concavity of nonlinear inequality constraints on the equation set. The validity and transient behavior of the proposed neural network are demonstrated by some simulation results.",4
Online Learning of Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process Mixture of Generalized Dirichlet Distributions With Feature Selection.,"In this paper, a novel statistical generative model based on hierarchical Pitman-Yor process and generalized Dirichlet distributions (GDs) is presented. The proposed model allows us to perform joint clustering and feature selection thanks to the interesting properties of the GD distribution. We develop an online variational inference algorithm, formulated in terms of the minimization of a Kullback-Leibler divergence, of our resulting model that tackles the problem of learning from high-dimensional examples. This variational Bayes formulation allows simultaneously estimating the parameters, determining the model's complexity, and selecting the appropriate relevant features for the clustering structure. Moreover, the proposed online learning algorithm allows data instances to be processed in a sequential manner, which is critical for large-scale and real-time applications. Experiments conducted using challenging applications, namely, scene recognition and video segmentation, where our approach is viewed as an unsupervised technique for visual learning in high-dimensional spaces, showed that the proposed approach is suitable and promising.",4
Descriptor Learning via Supervised Manifold Regularization for Multioutput Regression.,"Multioutput regression has recently shown great ability to solve challenging problems in both computer vision and medical image analysis. However, due to the huge image variability and ambiguity, it is fundamentally challenging to handle the highly complex input-target relationship of multioutput regression, especially with indiscriminate high-dimensional representations. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised descriptor learning (SDL) algorithm for multioutput regression, which can establish discriminative and compact feature representations to improve the multivariate estimation performance. The SDL is formulated as generalized low-rank approximations of matrices with a supervised manifold regularization. The SDL is able to simultaneously extract discriminative features closely related to multivariate targets and remove irrelevant and redundant information by transforming raw features into a new low-dimensional space aligned to targets. The achieved discriminative while compact descriptor largely reduces the variability and ambiguity for multioutput regression, which enables more accurate and efficient multivariate estimation. We conduct extensive evaluation of the proposed SDL on both synthetic data and real-world multioutput regression tasks for both computer vision and medical image analysis. Experimental results have shown that the proposed SDL can achieve high multivariate estimation accuracy on all tasks and largely outperforms the algorithms in the state of the arts. Our method establishes a novel SDL framework for multioutput regression, which can be widely used to boost the performance in different applications.",4
An Approach to Stable Gradient-Descent Adaptation of Higher Order Neural Units.,"Stability evaluation of a weight-update system of higher order neural units (HONUs) with polynomial aggregation of neural inputs (also known as classes of polynomial neural networks) for adaptation of both feedforward and recurrent HONUs by a gradient descent method is introduced. An essential core of the approach is based on the spectral radius of a weight-update system, and it allows stability monitoring and its maintenance at every adaptation step individually. Assuring the stability of the weight-update system (at every single adaptation step) naturally results in the adaptation stability of the whole neural architecture that adapts to the target data. As an aside, the used approach highlights the fact that the weight optimization of HONU is a linear problem, so the proposed approach can be generally extended to any neural architecture that is linear in its adaptable parameters.",4
Dynamic Surface Control for a Class of Nonlinear Feedback Linearizable Systems With Actuator Failures.,"In this brief, we propose a dynamic surface control with actuator failure compensation for a class of feedback linearizable systems with locally Lipschitz nonlinearities. First, a dynamic surface state feedback control scheme is designed, which incorporates radial basis function networks in a novel approach, to compensate system uncertainties and dynamic changes induced by actuator failures. Then, an output feedback controller is obtained by means of high-gain observers. It is proved that our control schemes guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the system, and that the output tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small residual set. Finally, a simulation is carried out to illustrate the performance of the designed control schemes.",4
A Novel Locally Linear KNN Method With Applications to Visual Recognition.,"A locally linear K Nearest Neighbor (LLK) method is presented in this paper with applications to robust visual recognition. Specifically, the concept of an ideal representation is first presented, which improves upon the traditional sparse representation in many ways. The objective function based on a host of criteria for sparsity, locality, and reconstruction is then optimized to derive a novel representation, which is an approximation to the ideal representation. The novel representation is further processed by two classifiers, namely, an LLK-based classifier and a locally linear nearest mean-based classifier, for visual recognition. The proposed classifiers are shown to connect to the Bayes decision rule for minimum error. Additional new theoretical analysis is presented, such as the nonnegative constraint, the group regularization, and the computational efficiency of the proposed LLK method. New methods such as a shifted power transformation for improving reliability, a coefficients' truncating method for enhancing generalization, and an improved marginal Fisher analysis method for feature extraction are proposed to further improve visual recognition performance. Extensive experiments are implemented to evaluate the proposed LLK method for robust visual recognition. In particular, eight representative data sets are applied for assessing the performance of the LLK method for various visual recognition applications, such as action recognition, scene recognition, object recognition, and face recognition.",4
Design of Probabilistic Boolean Networks Based on Network Structure and Steady-State Probabilities.,"In this brief, we consider the problem of finding a probabilistic Boolean network (PBN) based on a network structure and desired steady-state properties. In systems biology and synthetic biology, such problems are important as an inverse problem. Using a matrix-based representation of PBNs, a solution method for this problem is proposed. The problem of finding a BN has been studied so far. In the problem of finding a PBN, we must calculate not only the Boolean functions, but also the probabilities of selecting a Boolean function and the number of candidates of the Boolean functions. Hence, the problem of finding a PBN is more difficult than that of finding a BN. The effectiveness of the proposed method is presented by numerical examples.",4
The Growing Hierarchical Neural Gas Self-Organizing Neural Network.,"The growing neural gas (GNG) self-organizing neural network stands as one of the most successful examples of unsupervised learning of a graph of processing units. Despite its success, little attention has been devoted to its extension to a hierarchical model, unlike other models such as the self-organizing map, which has many hierarchical versions. Here, a hierarchical GNG is presented, which is designed to learn a tree of graphs. Moreover, the original GNG algorithm is improved by a distinction between a growth phase where more units are added until no significant improvement in the quantization error is obtained, and a convergence phase where no unit creation is allowed. This means that a principled mechanism is established to control the growth of the structure. Experiments are reported, which demonstrate the self-organization and hierarchy learning abilities of our approach and its performance for vector quantization applications.",4
Visual Recognition by Learning From Web Data via Weakly Supervised Domain Generalization.,"In this paper, a weakly supervised domain generalization (WSDG) method is proposed for real-world visual recognition tasks, in which we train classifiers by using Web data (e.g., Web images and Web videos) with noisy labels. In particular, two challenging problems need to be solved when learning robust classifiers, in which the first issue is to cope with the label noise of training Web data from the source domain, while the second issue is to enhance the generalization capability of learned classifiers to an arbitrary target domain. In order to handle the first problem, the training samples within each category are partitioned into clusters, where we use one bag to denote each cluster and instances to denote the samples in each cluster. Then, we identify a proportion of good training samples in each bag and train robust classifiers by using the good training samples, which leads to a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem. In order to handle the second problem, we assume that the training samples possibly form a set of hidden domains, with each hidden domain associated with a distinctive data distribution. Then, for each category and each hidden latent domain, we propose to learn one classifier by extending our MIL formulation, which leads to our WSDG approach. In the testing stage, our approach can obtain better generalization capability by effectively integrating multiple classifiers from different latent domains in each category. Moreover, our WSDG approach is further extended to utilize additional textual descriptions associated with Web data as privileged information (PI), although testing data do not have such PI. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets indicate that our newly proposed methods are effective for real-world visual recognition tasks by learning from Web data.",4
Iterative Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Solving Unknown Nonlinear Zero-Sum Game Based on Online Data.,"Hinfinity control is a powerful method to solve the disturbance attenuation problems that occur in some control systems. The design of such controllers relies on solving the zero-sum game (ZSG). But in practical applications, the exact dynamics is mostly unknown. Identification of dynamics also produces errors that are detrimental to the control performance. To overcome this problem, an iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve the continuous-time, unknown nonlinear ZSG with only online data. A model-free approach to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation is developed based on the policy iteration method. Control and disturbance policies and value are approximated by neural networks (NNs) under the critic-actor-disturber structure. The NN weights are solved by the least-squares method. According to the theoretical analysis, our algorithm is equivalent to a Gauss-Newton method solving an optimization problem, and it converges uniformly to the optimal solution. The online data can also be used repeatedly, which is highly efficient. Simulation results demonstrate its feasibility to solve the unknown nonlinear ZSG. When compared with other algorithms, it saves a significant amount of online measurement time.",4
Dynamical Analysis of the Hindmarsh-Rose Neuron With Time Delays.,"This brief is mainly concerned with a series of dynamical analyses of the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron with state-dependent time delays. The dynamical analyses focus on stability, Hopf bifurcation, as well as chaos and chaos control. Through the stability and bifurcation analysis, we determine that increasing the external current causes the excitable HR neuron to exhibit periodic or chaotic bursting/spiking behaviors and emit subcritical Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, by choosing a fixed external current and varying the time delay, the stability of the HR neuron is affected. We analyze the chaotic behaviors of the HR neuron under a fixed external current through time series, bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponents, and Lyapunov dimension. We also analyze the synchronization of the chaotic time-delayed HR neuron through nonlinear control. Based on an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with triple integral terms, a nonlinear feedback control scheme is designed to achieve synchronization between the uncontrolled and controlled models. The proposed synchronization criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities to achieve the global asymptotical stability of the considered error model under the designed control scheme. Finally, numerical simulations pertaining to stability, Hopf bifurcation, periodic, chaotic, and synchronized models are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results.",4
An Adaptive NN-Based Approach for Fault-Tolerant Control of Nonlinear Time-Varying Delay Systems With Unmodeled Dynamics.,"This paper presents an adaptive neural network (NN)-based fault-tolerant control approach for the compensation of actuator failures in nonlinear systems with time-varying delay. The novelty of this paper lies in the fact that both the lock in place and loss of effectiveness faults, unmodeled dynamics, and dynamic disturbances are catered for simultaneously. Furthermore, this is achieved by the adaptation of only one parameter, which simplifies the computation of the control effort, and therefore extends its applicability. In the approach, the Razumikhin lemma and a dynamic signal are employed. It is shown that the output of the system converges to a neighborhood of the reference signal and the semiglobal boundedness of all signals is guaranteed. A simulation example is used to illustrate the validity and efficacy of the approach.",4
Dissimilarity-Based Ensembles for Multiple Instance Learning.,"In multiple instance learning, objects are sets (bags) of feature vectors (instances) rather than individual feature vectors. In this paper, we address the problem of how these bags can best be represented. Two standard approaches are to use (dis)similarities between bags and prototype bags, or between bags and prototype instances. The first approach results in a relatively low-dimensional representation, determined by the number of training bags, whereas the second approach results in a relatively high-dimensional representation, determined by the total number of instances in the training set. However, an advantage of the latter representation is that the informativeness of the prototype instances can be inferred. In this paper, a third, intermediate approach is proposed, which links the two approaches and combines their strengths. Our classifier is inspired by a random subspace ensemble, and considers subspaces of the dissimilarity space, defined by subsets of instances, as prototypes. We provide insight into the structure of some popular multiple instance problems and show state-of-the-art performances on these data sets.",4
Improving Visual Saliency Computing With Emotion Intensity.,"Saliency maps that integrate individual feature maps into a global measure of visual attention are widely used to estimate human gaze density. Most of the existing methods consider low-level visual features and locations of objects, and/or emphasize the spatial position with center prior. Recent psychology research suggests that emotions strongly influence human visual attention. In this paper, we explore the influence of emotional content on visual attention. On top of the traditional bottom-up saliency map generation, our saliency map is generated in cooperation with three emotion factors, i.e., general emotional content, facial expression intensity, and emotional object locations. Experiments, carried out on National University of Singapore Eye Fixation (a public eye tracking data set), demonstrate that incorporating emotion does improve the quality of visual saliency maps computed by bottom-up approaches for the gaze density estimation. Our method increases about 0.1 on an average of area under the curve of receiver operation characteristic curve, compared with the four baseline bottom-up approaches (Itti's, attention based on information maximization, saliency using natural, and graph-based vision saliency).",4
Exponential Synchronization of Memristive Neural Networks With Delays: Interval Matrix Method.,"This paper considers the global exponential synchronization of drive-response memristive neural networks (MNNs) with heterogeneous time-varying delays. Because the parameters of MNNs are state-dependent, the MNNs may exhibit unexpected parameter mismatch when different initial conditions are chosen. Therefore, traditional robust control scheme cannot guarantee the synchronization of MNNs. Under the framework of Filippov solution, the drive and response MNNs are first transformed into systems with interval parameters. Then suitable controllers are designed to overcome the problem of mismatched parameters and synchronize the coupled MNNs. Based on some novel Lyapunov functionals and interval matrix inequalities, several sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the exponential synchronization. Moreover, adaptive control is also investigated for the exponential synchronization. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.",4
Extending the Peak Bandwidth of Parameters for Softmax Selection in Reinforcement Learning.,"Softmax selection is one of the most popular methods for action selection in reinforcement learning. Although various recently proposed methods may be more effective with full parameter tuning, implementing a complicated method that requires the tuning of many parameters can be difficult. Thus, softmax selection is still worth revisiting, considering the cost savings of its implementation and tuning. In fact, this method works adequately in practice with only one parameter appropriately set for the environment. The aim of this paper is to improve the variable setting of this method to extend the bandwidth of good parameters, thereby reducing the cost of implementation and parameter tuning. To achieve this, we take advantage of the asymptotic equipartition property in a Markov decision process to extend the peak bandwidth of softmax selection. Using a variety of episodic tasks, we show that our setting is effective in extending the bandwidth and that it yields a better policy in terms of stability. The bandwidth is quantitatively assessed in a series of statistical tests.",4
A Memristive Multilayer Cellular Neural Network With Applications to Image Processing.,"The memristor has been extensively studied in electrical engineering and biological sciences as a means to compactly implement the synaptic function in neural networks. The cellular neural network (CNN) is one of the most implementable artificial neural network models and capable of massively parallel analog processing. In this paper, a novel memristive multilayer CNN (Mm-CNN) model is presented along with its performance analysis and applications. In this new CNN design, the memristor crossbar circuit acts as the synapse, which realizes one signed synaptic weight with a pair of memristors and performs the synaptic weighting compactly and linearly. Moreover, the complex weighted summation is executed in an efficient way with a proper design of Mm-CNN cell circuits. The proposed Mm-CNN has several merits, such as compactness, nonvolatility, versatility, and programmability of synaptic weights. Its performance in several image processing applications is illustrated through simulations.",4
Passivity of Directed and Undirected Complex Dynamical Networks With Adaptive Coupling Weights.,"A complex dynamical network consisting of N identical neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms is considered in this paper. First, several passivity definitions for the systems with different dimensions of input and output are given. By utilizing some inequality techniques, several criteria are presented, ensuring the passivity of the complex dynamical network under the designed adaptive law. Then, we discuss the relationship between the synchronization and output strict passivity of the proposed network model. Furthermore, these results are extended to the case when the topological structure of the network is undirected. Finally, two examples with numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed results.",4
Understanding Social Causalities Behind Human Action Sequences.,"Social causality study on human action sequences is useful and important to improve our understandings to human behaviors on online social networks. The redundant indirect causalities and unobserved confounding factors, such as homophily and simultaneity phenomena, contribute to the huge challenges on accurate causal discovery on such human actions. A causal relationship exists between two persons, if the actions of one person are significantly affected by the actions of the other person, while fairly independent of her/his own prior actions. In this paper, we design a systematic approach based on conditional independence testing to detect such asymmetric relations, even when there are latent confounders underneath the observational action sequences. Technically, a group of asymmetric independence tests are conducted to infer the loose causal directions between action sequence pairs, followed by another group of tests to distinguish different types of relationships, e.g., homophily and simultaneity. Finally, a causal structure learning method is employed to output pairwise causalities with redundant indirect causalities eliminated. Empirical evaluations on simulated data verify the effectiveness and scalability of our proposals. We also present four interesting patterns of causal relations found by our algorithm, on real Sina Weibo feeds, including two new patterns never reported in previous studies.",4
Tensor LRR and Sparse Coding-Based Subspace Clustering.,"Subspace clustering groups a set of samples from a union of several linear subspaces into clusters, so that the samples in the same cluster are drawn from the same linear subspace. In the majority of the existing work on subspace clustering, clusters are built based on feature information, while sample correlations in their original spatial structure are simply ignored. Besides, original high-dimensional feature vector contains noisy/redundant information, and the time complexity grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) and sparse coding-based (TLRRSC) subspace clustering method by simultaneously considering feature information and spatial structures. TLRR seeks the lowest rank representation over original spatial structures along all spatial directions. Sparse coding learns a dictionary along feature spaces, so that each sample can be represented by a few atoms of the learned dictionary. The affinity matrix used for spectral clustering is built from the joint similarities in both spatial and feature spaces. TLRRSC can well capture the global structure and inherent feature information of data and provide a robust subspace segmentation from corrupted data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets show that TLRRSC outperforms several established stateof- the-art methods.",4
A Survey of Memristive Threshold Logic Circuits.,"In this paper, we review different memristive threshold logic (MTL) circuits that are inspired from the synaptic action of the flow of neurotransmitters in the biological brain. The brainlike generalization ability and the area minimization of these threshold logic circuits aim toward crossing Moore's law boundaries at device, circuits, and systems levels. Fast switching memory, signal processing, control systems, programmable logic, image processing, reconfigurable computing, and pattern recognition are identified as some of the potential applications of MTL systems. The physical realization of nanoscale devices with memristive behavior from materials, such as TiO2, ferroelectrics, silicon, and polymers, has accelerated research effort in these application areas, inspiring the scientific community to pursue the design of high-speed, low-cost, low-power, and high-density neuromorphic architectures.",4
Bridging the Gap Between Imitation Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning.,"Learning from demonstrations is a paradigm by which an apprentice agent learns a control policy for a dynamic environment by observing demonstrations delivered by an expert agent. It is usually implemented as either imitation learning (IL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in the literature. On the one hand, IRL is a paradigm relying on the Markov decision processes, where the goal of the apprentice agent is to find a reward function from the expert demonstrations that could explain the expert behavior. On the other hand, IL consists in directly generalizing the expert strategy, observed in the demonstrations, to unvisited states (and it is therefore close to classification, when there is a finite set of possible decisions). While these two visions are often considered as opposite to each other, the purpose of this paper is to exhibit a formal link between these approaches from which new algorithms can be derived. We show that IL and IRL can be redefined in a way that they are equivalent, in the sense that there exists an explicit bijective operator (namely, the inverse optimal Bellman operator) between their respective spaces of solutions. To do so, we introduce the set-policy framework that creates a clear link between the IL and the IRL. As a result, the IL and IRL solutions making the best of both worlds are obtained. In addition, it is a unifying framework from which existing IL and IRL algorithms can be derived and which opens the way for the IL methods able to deal with the environment's dynamics. Finally, the IRL algorithms derived from the set-policy framework are compared with the algorithms belonging to the more common trajectory-matching family. Experiments demonstrate that the set-policy-based algorithms outperform both the standard IRL and IL ones and result in more robust solutions.",4
Switched-Observer-Based Adaptive Neural Control of MIMO Switched Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Control Gains.,"In this paper, the problem of adaptive neural output-feedback control is addressed for a class of multi-input multioutput (MIMO) switched uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown control gains. Neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate unknown nonlinear functions. In order to avoid the conservativeness caused by adoption of a common observer for all subsystems, an MIMO NN switched observer is designed to estimate unmeasurable states. A new switched observer-based adaptive neural control technique for the problem studied is then provided by exploiting the classical average dwell time (ADT) method and the backstepping method and the Nussbaum gain technique. It effectively handles the obstacle about the coexistence of multiple Nussbaum-type function terms, and improves the classical ADT method, since the exponential decline property of Lyapunov functions for individual subsystems is no longer satisfied. It is shown that the technique proposed is able to guarantee semiglobal uniformly ultimately boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system under a class of switching signals with ADT, and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. The effectiveness of the approach proposed is illustrated by its application to a two inverted pendulum system.",4
Railway Track Circuit Fault Diagnosis Using Recurrent Neural Networks.,"Timely detection and identification of faults in railway track circuits are crucial for the safety and availability of railway networks. In this paper, the use of the long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is proposed to accomplish these tasks based on the commonly available measurement signals. By considering the signals from multiple track circuits in a geographic area, faults are diagnosed from their spatial and temporal dependences. A generative model is used to show that the LSTM network can learn these dependences directly from the data. The network correctly classifies 99.7% of the test input sequences, with no false positive fault detections. In addition, the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method is used to examine the resulting network, further showing that it has learned the relevant dependences in the data. Finally, we compare our LSTM network with a convolutional network trained on the same task. From this comparison, we conclude that the LSTM network architecture is better suited for the railway track circuit fault detection and identification tasks than the convolutional network.",4
The Proximal Trajectory Algorithm in SVM Cross Validation.,"We propose a bilevel cross-validation scheme for support vector machine (SVM) model selection based on the construction of the entire regularization path. Since such path is a particular case of the more general proximal trajectory concept from nonsmooth optimization, we propose for its construction an algorithm based on solving a finite number of structured linear programs. Our methodology, differently from other approaches, works directly on the primal form of SVM. Numerical results are presented on binary data sets drawn from literature.",4
Hybrid Sampling-Based Clustering Ensemble With Global and Local Constitutions.,"Among a number of ensemble learning techniques, boosting and bagging are the most popular sampling-based ensemble approaches for classification problems. Boosting is considered stronger than bagging on noise-free data set with complex class structures, whereas bagging is more robust than boosting in cases where noise data are present. In this paper, we extend both ensemble approaches to clustering tasks, and propose a novel hybrid sampling-based clustering ensemble by combining the strengths of boosting and bagging. In our approach, the input partitions are iteratively generated via a hybrid process inspired by both boosting and bagging. Then, a novel consensus function is proposed to encode the local and global cluster structure of input partitions into a single representation, and applies a single clustering algorithm to such representation to obtain the consolidated consensus partition. Our approach has been evaluated on 2-D-synthetic data, collection of benchmarks, and real-world facial recognition data sets, which show that the proposed technique outperforms the existing benchmarks for a variety of clustering tasks.",4
Storing Sequences in Binary Tournament-Based Neural Networks.,"An extension to a recently introduced architecture of clique-based neural networks is presented. This extension makes it possible to store sequences with high efficiency. To obtain this property, network connections are provided with orientation and with flexible redundancy carried by both spatial and temporal redundancies, a mechanism of anticipation being introduced in the model. In addition to the sequence storage with high efficiency, this new scheme also offers biological plausibility. In order to achieve accurate sequence retrieval, a double-layered structure combining heteroassociation and autoassociation is also proposed.",4
Learning With Jensen-Tsallis Kernels.,"Jensen-type [Jensen-Shannon (JS) and Jensen-Tsallis] kernels were first proposed by Martins et al. (2009). These kernels are based on JS divergences that originated in the information theory. In this paper, we extend the Jensen-type kernels on probability measures to define positive-definite kernels on Euclidean space. We show that the special cases of these kernels include dot-product kernels. Since Jensen-type divergences are multidistribution divergences, we propose their multipoint variants, and study spectral clustering and kernel methods based on these. We also provide experimental studies on benchmark image database and gene expression database that show the benefits of the proposed kernels compared with the existing kernels. The experiments on clustering also demonstrate the use of constructing multipoint similarities.",4
Adaptation to New Microphones Using Artificial Neural Networks With Trainable Activation Functions.,"Model adaptation is a key technique that enables a modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to adjust its parameters, using a small amount of enrolment data, to the nuances in the speech spectrum due to microphone mismatch in the training and test data. In this brief, we investigate four different adaptation schemes for connectionist (also known as hybrid) ASR systems that learn microphone-specific hidden unit contributions, given some adaptation material. This solution is made possible adopting one of the following schemes: 1) the use of Hermite activation functions; 2) the introduction of bias and slope parameters in the sigmoid activation functions; 3) the injection of an amplitude parameter specific for each sigmoid unit; or 4) the combination of 2) and 3). Such a simple yet effective solution allows the adapted model to be stored in a small-sized storage space, a highly desirable property of adaptation algorithms for deep neural networks that are suitable for large-scale online deployment. Experimental results indicate that the investigated approaches reduce word error rates on the standard Spoke 6 task of the Wall Street Journal corpus compared with unadapted ASR systems. Moreover, the proposed adaptation schemes all perform better than simple multicondition training and comparable favorably against conventional linear regression-based approaches while using up to 15 orders of magnitude fewer parameters. The proposed adaptation strategies are also effective when a single adaptation sentence is available.",4
Global Synchronization of Multiple Recurrent Neural Networks With Time Delays via Impulsive Interactions.,"In this paper, new results on the global synchronization of multiple recurrent neural networks (NNs) with time delays via impulsive interactions are presented. Impulsive interaction means that a number of NNs communicate with each other at impulse instants only, while they are independent at the remaining time. The communication topology among NNs is not required to be always connected and can switch ON and OFF at different impulse instants. By using the concept of sequential connectivity and the properties of stochastic matrices, a set of sufficient conditions depending on time delays is derived to ascertain global synchronization of multiple continuous-time recurrent NNs. In addition, a counterpart on the global synchronization of multiple discrete-time NNs is also discussed. Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate the results.",4
A Collective Neurodynamic Approach to Distributed Constrained Optimization.,"This paper presents a collective neurodynamic approach with multiple interconnected recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for distributed constrained optimization. The objective function of the distributed optimization problems to be solved is a sum of local convex objective functions, which may be nonsmooth. Subject to its local constraints, each local objective function is minimized individually by using an RNN, with consensus among others. In contrast to existing continuous-time distributed optimization methods, the proposed collective neurodynamic approach is capable of solving more general distributed optimization problems. Simulation results on three numerical examples are discussed to substantiate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed approach. In addition, an application to the optimal placement problem is delineated to demonstrate the viability of the approach.",4
Assessing the Influence of an Individual Event in Complex Fault Spreading Network Based on Dynamic Uncertain Causality Graph.,"Identifying the pivotal causes and highly influential spreaders in fault propagation processes is crucial for improving the maintenance decision making for complex systems under abnormal and emergency situations. A dynamic uncertain causality graph-based method is introduced in this paper to explicitly model the uncertain causalities among system components, identify fault conditions, locate the fault origins, and predict the spreading tendency by means of probabilistic reasoning. A new algorithm is proposed to assess the impacts of an individual event by investigating the corresponding node's time-variant betweenness centrality and the strength of global causal influence in the fault propagation network. The algorithm does not depend on the whole original and static network but on the real-time spreading behaviors and dynamics, which makes the algorithm to be specifically targeted and more efficient. Experiments on both simulated networks and real-world systems demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and comprehensibility of the proposed method for the fault management of power grids and other complex networked systems.",4
Structural Minimax Probability Machine.,"Minimax probability machine (MPM) is an interesting discriminative classifier based on generative prior knowledge. It can directly estimate the probabilistic accuracy bound by minimizing the maximum probability of misclassification. The structural information of data is an effective way to represent prior knowledge, and has been found to be vital for designing classifiers in real-world problems. However, MPM only considers the prior probability distribution of each class with a given mean and covariance matrix, which does not efficiently exploit the structural information of data. In this paper, we use two finite mixture models to capture the structural information of the data from binary classification. For each subdistribution in a finite mixture model, only its mean and covariance matrix are assumed to be known. Based on the finite mixture models, we propose a structural MPM (SMPM). SMPM can be solved effectively by a sequence of the second-order cone programming problems. Moreover, we extend a linear model of SMPM to a nonlinear model by exploiting kernelization techniques. We also show that the SMPM can be interpreted as a large margin classifier and can be transformed to support vector machine and maxi-min margin machine under certain special conditions. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of SMPM.",4
An Alternating Identification Algorithm for a Class of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems.,"While modeling nonlinear systems by combining a linear model with a nonlinear compensation term, namely, virtual unmodeled dynamics (VUD), the parameter estimation of the linear model and the learning-based VUD estimate influences and interacts with each other simultaneously. This paper aims to develop an alternating identification scheme for resolving such a challenging problem, where a projection algorithm is employed to identify the linear model and a feedforward neural network is used to model the VUD of a class of nonlinear dynamical systems. An open-loop estimation algorithm on the VUD is first presented under the known linear model, followed by an alternating identification algorithm for completely unknown nonlinear systems. Algorithm description is given and some simulation studies on multiple input and multiple output nonlinear systems are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling techniques.",4
Import Vector Domain Description: A Kernel Logistic One-Class Learning Algorithm.,"Recognizing the samples belonging to one class in a heterogeneous data set is a very interesting but tough machine learning task. Some samples of the data set can be actual outliers or members of other classes for which training examples are lacking. In contrast to other kernel approaches present in the literature, in this work, the problem is faced defining a one-class kernel machine that delivers the probability for a sample to belong to the support of the distribution and that can be efficiently trained by a hybrid sequential minimal optimization-expectation maximization algorithm. Due to the analogy to the import vector machine and to the one-class approach, we named the method import vector domain description (IVDD). IVDD was tested on a toy 2-D data set in order to characterize its behavior on a set of widely used benchmarking UCI data sets and, lastly, challenged against a real world outlier detection data set. All the results were compared against state-of-the-art closely related methods such as one-class-SVM and Support Vector Domain Description, proving that the algorithm is equally accurate with the additional advantage of delivering the probability estimate for each sample. Finally, a few variants aimed at providing memory savings and/or computational speed-up in the light of big data analysis are briefly sketched.",4
Exponential Synchronization for Markovian Stochastic Coupled Neural Networks of Neutral-Type via Adaptive Feedback Control.,"In this paper, we investigate the adaptive exponential synchronization in both the mean square and the almost sure senses for an array of N identical Markovian stochastic coupled neural networks of neutral-type with time-varying delay and random coupling strength. The generalized Lyapunov theorem of the exponential stability in the mean square for the neutral stochastic Markov system with the time-varying delay is first established. The time-varying delay in the system is assumed to be a bounded measurable function. Then, sufficient conditions to guarantee the exponential synchronization in the mean square for the underlying system are developed under an adaptive feedback controller, which are given in terms of the M -matrix and the algebraic inequalities. Under the same conditions, the almost sure exponential synchronization is also presented. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed theoretical results.",4
Observer-Based Adaptive Neural Network Trajectory Tracking Control for Remotely Operated Vehicle.,"This paper focuses on the adaptive trajectory tracking control for a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with an unknown dynamic model and the unmeasured states. Unlike most previous trajectory tracking control approaches, in this paper, the velocity states and the angular velocity states in the body-fixed frame are unmeasured, and the thrust model is inaccurate. Obviously, it is more in line with the actual ROV systems. Since the dynamic model is unknown, a new local recurrent neural network (local RNN) structure with fast learning speed is proposed for online identification. To estimate the unmeasured states, an adaptive terminal sliding-mode state observer based on the local RNN is proposed, so that the finite-time convergence of the trajectory tracking error can be guaranteed. Considering the problem of inaccurate thrust model, an adaptive scale factor is introduced into thrust model, and the thruster control signal is considered as the input of the trajectory tracking system directly. Based on the local RNN output, the adaptive scale factor, and the state estimation values, an adaptive trajectory tracking control law is constructed. The stability of the trajectory tracking control system is analyzed by the Lyapunov theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is illustrated by simulations.",4
Characterization of Linearly Separable Boolean Functions: A Graph-Theoretic Perspective.,"In this paper, we present a novel approach for studying Boolean function in a graph-theoretic perspective. In particular, we first transform a Boolean function f of n variables into an induced subgraph Hf of the n -dimensional hypercube, and then, we show the properties of linearly separable Boolean functions on the basis of the analysis of the structure of Hf . We define a new class of graphs, called hyperstar, and prove that the induced subgraph Hf of any linearly separable Boolean function f is a hyperstar. The proposal of hyperstar helps us uncover a number of fundamental properties of linearly separable Boolean functions in this paper.",4
Label Propagation via Teaching-to-Learn and Learning-to-Teach.,"How to propagate label information from labeled examples to unlabeled examples over a graph has been intensively studied for a long time. Existing graph-based propagation algorithms usually treat unlabeled examples equally, and transmit seed labels to the unlabeled examples that are connected to the labeled examples in a neighborhood graph. However, such a popular propagation scheme is very likely to yield inaccurate propagation, because it falls short of tackling ambiguous but critical data points (e.g., outliers). To this end, this paper treats the unlabeled examples in different levels of difficulties by assessing their reliability and discriminability, and explicitly optimizes the propagation quality by manipulating the propagation sequence to move from simple to difficult examples. In particular, we propose a novel iterative label propagation algorithm in which each propagation alternates between two paradigms, teaching-to-learn and learning-to-teach (TLLT). In the teaching-to-learn step, the learner conducts the propagation on the simplest unlabeled examples designated by the teacher. In the learning-to-teach step, the teacher incorporates the learner's feedback to adjust the choice of the subsequent simplest examples. The proposed TLLT strategy critically improves the accuracy of label propagation, making our algorithm substantially robust to the values of tuning parameters, such as the Gaussian kernel width used in graph construction. The merits of our algorithm are theoretically justified and empirically demonstrated through experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world data sets.",4
Adaptive Neural Network Nonparametric Identifier With Normalized Learning Laws.,"This paper addresses the design of a normalized convergent learning law for neural networks (NNs) with continuous dynamics. The NN is used here to obtain a nonparametric model for uncertain systems described by a set of ordinary differential equations. The source of uncertainties is the presence of some external perturbations and poor knowledge of the nonlinear function describing the system dynamics. A new adaptive algorithm based on normalized algorithms was used to adjust the weights of the NN. The adaptive algorithm was derived by means of a nonstandard logarithmic Lyapunov function (LLF). Two identifiers were designed using two variations of LLFs leading to a normalized learning law for the first identifier and a variable gain normalized learning law. In the case of the second identifier, the inclusion of normalized learning laws yields to reduce the size of the convergence region obtained as solution of the practical stability analysis. On the other hand, the velocity of convergence for the learning laws depends on the norm of errors in inverse form. This fact avoids the peaking transient behavior in the time evolution of weights that accelerates the convergence of identification error. A numerical example demonstrates the improvements achieved by the algorithm introduced in this paper compared with classical schemes with no-normalized continuous learning methods. A comparison of the identification performance achieved by the no-normalized identifier and the ones developed in this paper shows the benefits of the learning law proposed in this paper.",4
Solution Path for Pin-SVM Classifiers With Positive and Negative $\tau $ Values.,"Applying the pinball loss in a support vector machine (SVM) classifier results in pin-SVM. The pinball loss is characterized by a parameter tau . Its value is related to the quantile level and different tau values are suitable for different problems. In this paper, we establish an algorithm to find the entire solution path for pin-SVM with different tau values. This algorithm is based on the fact that the optimal solution to pin-SVM is continuous and piecewise linear with respect to tau . We also show that the nonnegativity constraint on tau is not necessary, i.e., tau can be extended to negative values. First, in some applications, a negative tau leads to better accuracy. Second, tau = -1 corresponds to a simple solution that links SVM and the classical kernel rule. The solution for tau = -1 can be obtained directly and then be used as a starting point of the solution path. The proposed method efficiently traverses tau values through the solution path, and then achieves good performance by a suitable tau . In particular, tau = 0 corresponds to C-SVM, meaning that the traversal algorithm can output a result at least as good as C-SVM with respect to validation error.",4
Learning With Auxiliary Less-Noisy Labels.,"Obtaining a sufficient number of accurate labels to form a training set for learning a classifier can be difficult due to the limited access to reliable label resources. Instead, in real-world applications, less-accurate labels, such as labels from nonexpert labelers, are often used. However, learning with less-accurate labels can lead to serious performance deterioration because of the high noise rate. Although several learning methods (e.g., noise-tolerant classifiers) have been advanced to increase classification performance in the presence of label noise, only a few of them take the noise rate into account and utilize both noisy but easily accessible labels and less-noisy labels, a small amount of which can be obtained with an acceptable added time cost and expense. In this brief, we propose a learning method, in which not only noisy labels but also auxiliary less-noisy labels, which are available in a small portion of the training data, are taken into account. Based on a flipping probability noise model and a logistic regression classifier, this method estimates the noise rate parameters, infers ground-truth labels, and learns the classifier simultaneously in a maximum likelihood manner. The proposed method yields three learning algorithms, which correspond to three prior knowledge states regarding the less-noisy labels. The experiments show that the proposed method is tolerant to label noise, and outperforms classifiers that do not explicitly consider the auxiliary less-noisy labels.",4
Embedded Streaming Deep Neural Networks Accelerator With Applications.,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become a very powerful tool in visual perception. DCNNs have applications in autonomous robots, security systems, mobile phones, and automobiles, where high throughput of the feedforward evaluation phase and power efficiency are important. Because of this increased usage, many field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerators have been proposed. In this paper, we present an optimized streaming method for DCNNs' hardware accelerator on an embedded platform. The streaming method acts as a compiler, transforming a high-level representation of DCNNs into operation codes to execute applications in a hardware accelerator. The proposed method utilizes maximum computational resources available based on a novel-scheduled routing topology that combines data reuse and data concatenation. It is tested with a hardware accelerator implemented on the Xilinx Kintex-7 XC7K325T FPGA. The system fully explores weight-level and node-level parallelizations of DCNNs and achieves a peak performance of 247 G-ops while consuming less than 4 W of power. We test our system with applications on object classification and object detection in real-world scenarios. Our results indicate high-performance efficiency, outperforming all other presented platforms while running these applications.",4
Impulsive Multisynchronization of Coupled Multistable Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay.,"This paper studies the synchronization problem of coupled delayed multistable neural networks (NNs) with directed topology. To begin with, several sufficient conditions are developed in terms of algebraic inequalities such that every subnetwork has multiple locally exponentially stable periodic orbits or equilibrium points. Then two new concepts named dynamical multisynchronization (DMS) and static multisynchronization (SMS) are introduced to describe the two novel kinds of synchronization manifolds. Using the impulsive control strategy and the Razumikhin-type technique, some sufficient conditions for both the DMS and the SMS of the controlled coupled delayed multistable NNs with fixed and switching topologies are derived, respectively. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.",4
Adaptive Event-Triggered Control Based on Heuristic Dynamic Programming for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems.,"This paper presents the design of a novel adaptive event-triggered control method based on the heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) technique for nonlinear discrete-time systems with unknown system dynamics. In the proposed method, the control law is only updated when the event-triggered condition is violated. Compared with the periodic updates in the traditional adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) control, the proposed method can reduce the computation and transmission cost. An actor-critic framework is used to learn the optimal event-triggered control law and the value function. Furthermore, a model network is designed to estimate the system state vector. The main contribution of this paper is to design a new trigger threshold for discrete-time systems. A detailed Lyapunov stability analysis shows that our proposed event-triggered controller can asymptotically stabilize the discrete-time systems. Finally, we test our method on two different discrete-time systems, and the simulation results are included.",4
Approximate Optimal Control of Affine Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems Using Event-Sampled Neurodynamic Programming.,"This paper presents an approximate optimal control of nonlinear continuous-time systems in affine form by using the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with event-sampled state and input vectors. The knowledge of the system dynamics is relaxed by using a neural network (NN) identifier with event-sampled inputs. The value function, which becomes an approximate solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, is generated by using event-sampled NN approximator. Subsequently, the NN identifier and the approximated value function are utilized to obtain the optimal control policy. Both the identifier and value function approximator weights are tuned only at the event-sampled instants leading to an aperiodic update scheme. A novel adaptive event sampling condition is designed to determine the sampling instants, such that the approximation accuracy and the stability are maintained. A positive lower bound on the minimum inter-sample time is guaranteed to avoid accumulation point, and the dependence of inter-sample time upon the NN weight estimates is analyzed. A local ultimate boundedness of the resulting nonlinear impulsive dynamical closed-loop system is shown. Finally, a numerical example is utilized to evaluate the performance of the near-optimal design. The net result is the design of an event-sampled ADP-based controller for nonlinear continuous-time systems.",4
Sparseness Analysis in the Pretraining of Deep Neural Networks.,"A major progress in deep multilayer neural networks (DNNs) is the invention of various unsupervised pretraining methods to initialize network parameters which lead to good prediction accuracy. This paper presents the sparseness analysis on the hidden unit in the pretraining process. In particular, we use the L1 -norm to measure sparseness and provide some sufficient conditions for that pretraining leads to sparseness with respect to the popular pretraining models-such as denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). Our experimental results demonstrate that when the sufficient conditions are satisfied, the pretraining models lead to sparseness. Our experiments also reveal that when using the sigmoid activation functions, pretraining plays an important sparseness role in DNNs with sigmoid (Dsigm), and when using the rectifier linear unit (ReLU) activation functions, pretraining becomes less effective for DNNs with ReLU (Drelu). Luckily, Drelu can reach a higher recognition accuracy than DNNs with pretraining (DAEs and RBMs), as it can capture the main benefit (such as sparseness-encouraging) of pretraining in Dsigm. However, ReLU is not adapted to the different firing rates in biological neurons, because the firing rate actually changes along with the varying membrane resistances. To address this problem, we further propose a family of rectifier piecewise linear units (RePLUs) to fit the different firing rates. The experimental results show that the performance of RePLU is better than ReLU, and is comparable with those with some pretraining techniques, such as RBMs and DAEs.",4
A Collective Neurodynamic Approach to Constrained Global Optimization.,"Global optimization is a long-lasting research topic in the field of optimization, posting many challenging theoretic and computational issues. This paper presents a novel collective neurodynamic method for solving constrained global optimization problems. At first, a one-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) is presented for searching the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the optimization problem under study. Next, a collective neuroydnamic optimization approach is developed by emulating the paradigm of brainstorming. Multiple RNNs are exploited cooperatively to search for the global optimal solutions in a framework of particle swarm optimization. Each RNN carries out a precise local search and converges to a candidate solution according to its own neurodynamics. The neuronal state of each neural network is repetitively reset by exchanging historical information of each individual network and the entire group. Wavelet mutation is performed to avoid prematurity, add diversity, and promote global convergence. It is proved in the framework of stochastic optimization that the proposed collective neurodynamic approach is capable of computing the global optimal solutions with probability one provided that a sufficiently large number of neural networks are utilized. The essence of the collective neurodynamic optimization approach lies in its potential to solve constrained global optimization problems in real time. The effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed approach are illustrated by using benchmark optimization problems.",4
CONE: Convex-Optimized-Synaptic Efficacies for Temporally Precise Spike Mapping.,"Spiking neural networks are well suited to perform time-dependent pattern recognition problems by encoding the temporal dimension in precise spike times. With an appropriate set of weights, a spiking neuron can emit precisely timed action potentials in response to spatiotemporal input spikes. However, deriving supervised learning rules for spike mapping is nontrivial due to the increased complexity. Existing methods rely on heuristic approaches that do not guarantee a convex objective function and, therefore, may not converge to a global minimum. In this paper, we present a novel technique to obtain the weights of spiking neurons by formulating the problem in a convex optimization framework, rendering it be compatible with the established methods. We introduce techniques to influence the weight distribution and membrane trajectory, and then study how these factors affect robustness in the presence of noise. In addition, we show how the existence of a solution can be determined and assess memory capacity limits of a neuron model using synthetic examples. The practical utility of our technique is further assessed by its application to gait-event detection using the experimental data.",4
Dual Low-Rank Pursuit: Learning Salient Features for Saliency Detection.,"Saliency detection is an important procedure for machines to understand visual world as humans do. In this paper, we consider a specific saliency detection problem of predicting human eye fixations when they freely view natural images, and propose a novel dual low-rank pursuit (DLRP) method. DLRP learns saliency-aware feature transformations by utilizing available supervision information and constructs discriminative bases for effectively detecting human fixation points under the popular low-rank and sparsity-pursuit framework. Benefiting from the embedded high-level information in the supervised learning process, DLRP is able to predict fixations accurately without performing the expensive object segmentation as in the previous works. Comprehensive experiments clearly show the superiority of the proposed DLRP method over the established state-of-the-art methods. We also empirically demonstrate that DLRP provides stronger generalization performance across different data sets and inherits the advantages of both the bottom-up- and top-down-based saliency detection methods.",4
Adaptive Neural Control of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems With State and Input Constraints.,"An adaptive neural control strategy for multiple input multiple output nonlinear systems with various constraints is presented in this paper. To deal with the nonsymmetric input nonlinearity and the constrained states, the proposed adaptive neural control is combined with the backstepping method, radial basis function neural network, barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), and disturbance observer. By ensuring the boundedness of the BLF of the closed-loop system, it is demonstrated that the output tracking is achieved with all states remaining in the constraint sets and the general assumption on nonsingularity of unknown control coefficient matrices has been eliminated. The constructed adaptive neural control has been rigorously proved that it can guarantee the semiglobally uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. Finally, the simulation studies on a 2-DOF robotic manipulator system indicate that the designed adaptive control is effective.",4
Salient Band Selection for Hyperspectral Image Classification via Manifold Ranking.,"Saliency detection has been a hot topic in recent years, and many efforts have been devoted in this area. Unfortunately, the results of saliency detection can hardly be utilized in general applications. The primary reason, we think, is unspecific definition of salient objects, which makes that the previously published methods cannot extend to practical applications. To solve this problem, we claim that saliency should be defined in a context and the salient band selection in hyperspectral image (HSI) is introduced as an example. Unfortunately, the traditional salient band selection methods suffer from the problem of inappropriate measurement of band difference. To tackle this problem, we propose to eliminate the drawbacks of traditional salient band selection methods by manifold ranking. It puts the band vectors in the more accurate manifold space and treats the saliency problem from a novel ranking perspective, which is considered to be the main contributions of this paper. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on three HSIs, and our method is compared with the six existing competitors. Results show that the proposed method is very effective and can achieve the best performance among the competitors.",4
"Mapping Temporal Variables Into the NeuCube for Improved Pattern Recognition, Predictive Modeling, and Understanding of Stream Data.","This paper proposes a new method for an optimized mapping of temporal variables, describing a temporal stream data, into the recently proposed NeuCube spiking neural network (SNN) architecture. This optimized mapping extends the use of the NeuCube, which was initially designed for spatiotemporal brain data, to work on arbitrary stream data and to achieve a better accuracy of temporal pattern recognition, a better and earlier event prediction, and a better understanding of complex temporal stream data through visualization of the NeuCube connectivity. The effect of the new mapping is demonstrated on three benchmark problems. The first one is the early prediction of patient sleep stage event from temporal physiological data. The second one is the pattern recognition of dynamic temporal patterns of traffic in the Bay Area of California and the last one is the Challenge 2012 contest data set. In all the cases, the use of the proposed mapping leads to an improved accuracy of pattern recognition and event prediction and a better understanding of the data when compared with traditional machine learning techniques or SNN reservoirs with an arbitrary mapping of the variables.",4
Objective Function and Learning Algorithm for the General Node Fault Situation.,"Fault tolerance is one interesting property of artificial neural networks. However, the existing fault models are able to describe limited node fault situations only, such as stuck-at-zero and stuck-at-one. There is no general model that is able to describe a large class of node fault situations. This paper studies the performance of faulty radial basis function (RBF) networks for the general node fault situation. We first propose a general node fault model that is able to describe a large class of node fault situations, such as stuck-at-zero, stuck-at-one, and the stuck-at level being with arbitrary distribution. Afterward, we derive an expression to describe the performance of faulty RBF networks. An objective function is then identified from the formula. With the objective function, a training algorithm for the general node situation is developed. Finally, a mean prediction error (MPE) formula that is able to estimate the test set error of faulty networks is derived. The application of the MPE formula in the selection of basis width is elucidated. Simulation experiments are then performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Sequential Nonlinear Learning for Distributed Multiagent Systems via Extreme Learning Machines.,"We study online nonlinear learning over distributed multiagent systems, where each agent employs a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) structure to sequentially minimize arbitrary loss functions. In particular, each agent trains its own SLFN using only the data that is revealed to itself. On the other hand, the aim of the multiagent system is to train the SLFN at each agent as well as the optimal centralized batch SLFN that has access to all the data, by exchanging information between neighboring agents. We address this problem by introducing a distributed subgradient-based extreme learning machine algorithm. The proposed algorithm provides guaranteed upper bounds on the performance of the SLFN at each agent and shows that each of these individual SLFNs asymptotically achieves the performance of the optimal centralized batch SLFN. Our performance guarantees explicitly distinguish the effects of data- and network-dependent parameters on the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle performance significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods in the machine learning and signal processing literature. Hence, the proposed method is highly appealing for the applications involving big data.",4
Holographic Graph Neuron: A Bioinspired Architecture for Pattern Processing.,"In this paper, we propose a new approach to implementing hierarchical graph neuron (HGN), an architecture for memorizing patterns of generic sensor stimuli, through the use of vector symbolic architectures. The adoption of a vector symbolic representation ensures a single-layer design while retaining the existing performance characteristics of HGN. This approach significantly improves the noise resistance of the HGN architecture, and enables a linear (with respect to the number of stored entries) time search for an arbitrary subpattern.",4
$\mu $ -Stability of Nonlinear Positive Systems With Unbounded Time-Varying Delays.,"The stability of the zero solution plays an important role in the investigation of positive systems. In this brief, we discuss the mu -stability of positive nonlinear systems with unbounded time-varying delays. The system is modeled by the continuous-time ordinary differential equation. Under some assumptions on the nonlinear functions, such as homogeneous, cooperative, and nondecreasing, we propose a novel transform, by which the nonlinear system reduces to a new system. Thus, we analyze its dynamics, which can simplify the nonlinear homogenous functions with respect to the arbitrary dilation map to those with respect to the standard dilation map. We finally get some new criteria for the global mu -stability taking the degree into consideration. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of obtained results.",4
Action and Event Recognition in Videos by Learning From Heterogeneous Web Sources.,"In this paper, we propose new approaches for action and event recognition by leveraging a large number of freely available Web videos (e.g., from Flickr video search engine) and Web images (e.g., from Bing and Google image search engines). We address this problem by formulating it as a new multi-domain adaptation problem, in which heterogeneous Web sources are provided. Specifically, we are given different types of visual features (e.g., the DeCAF features from Bing/Google images and the trajectory-based features from Flickr videos) from heterogeneous source domains and all types of visual features from the target domain. Considering the target domain is more relevant to some source domains, we propose a new approach named multi-domain adaptation with heterogeneous sources (MDA-HS) to effectively make use of the heterogeneous sources. In MDA-HS, we simultaneously seek for the optimal weights of multiple source domains, infer the labels of target domain samples, and learn an optimal target classifier. Moreover, as textual descriptions are often available for both Web videos and images, we propose a novel approach called MDA-HS using privileged information (MDA-HS+) to effectively incorporate the valuable textual information into our MDA-HS method, based on the recent learning using privileged information paradigm. MDA-HS+ can be further extended by using a new elastic-net-like regularization. We solve our MDA-HS and MDA-HS+ methods by using the cutting-plane algorithm, in which a multiple kernel learning problem is derived and solved. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposed approaches are effective for action and event recognition without requiring any labeled samples from the target domain.",4
Neural Network Control-Based Adaptive Learning Design for Nonlinear Systems With Full-State Constraints.,"In order to stabilize a class of uncertain nonlinear strict-feedback systems with full-state constraints, an adaptive neural network control method is investigated in this paper. The state constraints are frequently emerged in the real-life plants and how to avoid the violation of state constraints is an important task. By introducing a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to every step in a backstepping procedure, a novel adaptive backstepping design is well developed to ensure that the full-state constraints are not violated. At the same time, one remarkable feature is that the minimal learning parameters are employed in BLF backstepping design. By making use of Lyapunov analysis, we can prove that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded and the output is well driven to follow the desired output. Finally, a simulation is given to verify the effectiveness of the method.",4
Quantized Iterative Learning Consensus Tracking of Digital Networks With Limited Information Communication.,"This brief investigates the quantized iterative learning problem for digital networks with time-varying topologies. The information is first encoded as symbolic data and then transmitted. After the data are received, a decoder is used by the receiver to get an estimate of the sender's state. Iterative learning quantized communication is considered in the process of encoding and decoding. A sufficient condition is then presented to achieve the consensus tracking problem in a finite interval using the quantized iterative learning controllers. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the usefulness of the developed criterion.",4
Rate of Convergence of the FOCUSS Algorithm.,"Focal underdetermined system solver (FOCUSS) is a powerful method for basis selection and sparse representation, where it employs the [Formula: see text]-norm with p in (0,2) to measure the sparsity of solutions. In this paper, we give a systematical analysis on the rate of convergence of the FOCUSS algorithm with respect to p in (0,2) . We prove that the FOCUSS algorithm converges superlinearly for and linearly for usually, but may superlinearly in some very special scenarios. In addition, we verify its rates of convergence with respect to p by numerical experiments.",4
Robust Joint Graph Sparse Coding for Unsupervised Spectral Feature Selection.,"In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised spectral feature selection model by embedding a graph regularizer into the framework of joint sparse regression for preserving the local structures of data. To do this, we first extract the bases of training data by previous dictionary learning methods and, then, map original data into the basis space to generate their new representations, by proposing a novel joint graph sparse coding (JGSC) model. In JGSC, we first formulate its objective function by simultaneously taking subspace learning and joint sparse regression into account, then, design a new optimization solution to solve the resulting objective function, and further prove the convergence of the proposed solution. Furthermore, we extend JGSC to a robust JGSC (RJGSC) via replacing the least square loss function with a robust loss function, for achieving the same goals and also avoiding the impact of outliers. Finally, experimental results on real data sets showed that both JGSC and RJGSC outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of k -nearest neighbor classification performance.",4
Optimized Kernel Entropy Components.,"This brief addresses two main issues of the standard kernel entropy component analysis (KECA) algorithm: the optimization of the kernel decomposition and the optimization of the Gaussian kernel parameter. KECA roughly reduces to a sorting of the importance of kernel eigenvectors by entropy instead of variance, as in the kernel principal components analysis. In this brief, we propose an extension of the KECA method, named optimized KECA (OKECA), that directly extracts the optimal features retaining most of the data entropy by means of compacting the information in very few features (often in just one or two). The proposed method produces features which have higher expressive power. In particular, it is based on the independent component analysis framework, and introduces an extra rotation to the eigen decomposition, which is optimized via gradient-ascent search. This maximum entropy preservation suggests that OKECA features are more efficient than KECA features for density estimation. In addition, a critical issue in both the methods is the selection of the kernel parameter, since it critically affects the resulting performance. Here, we analyze the most common kernel length-scale selection criteria. The results of both the methods are illustrated in different synthetic and real problems. Results show that OKECA returns projections with more expressive power than KECA, the most successful rule for estimating the kernel parameter is based on maximum likelihood, and OKECA is more robust to the selection of the length-scale parameter in kernel density estimation.",4
Fair Energy Scheduling for Vehicle-to-Grid Networks Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming.,"Research on the smart grid is being given enormous supports worldwide due to its great significance in solving environmental and energy crises. Electric vehicles (EVs), which are powered by clean energy, are adopted increasingly year by year. It is predictable that the huge charge load caused by high EV penetration will have a considerable impact on the reliability of the smart grid. Therefore, fair energy scheduling for EV charge and discharge is proposed in this paper. By using the vehicle-to-grid technology, the scheduler controls the electricity loads of EVs considering fairness in the residential distribution network. We propose contribution-based fairness, in which EVs with high contributions have high priorities to obtain charge energy. The contribution value is defined by both the charge/discharge energy and the timing of the action. EVs can achieve higher contribution values when discharging during the load peak hours. However, charging during this time will decrease the contribution values seriously. We formulate the fair energy scheduling problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process. The methodology of adaptive dynamic programming is employed to maximize the long-term fairness by processing online network training. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed EV energy scheduling is able to mitigate and flatten the peak load in the distribution network. Furthermore, contribution-based fairness achieves a fast recovery of EV batteries that have deeply discharged and guarantee fairness in the full charge time of all EVs.",4
A Robust Regularization Path Algorithm for $\nu $ -Support Vector Classification.,"The nu -support vector classification has the advantage of using a regularization parameter nu to control the number of support vectors and margin errors. Recently, a regularization path algorithm for nu -support vector classification ( nu -SvcPath) suffers exceptions and singularities in some special cases. In this brief, we first present a new equivalent dual formulation for nu -SVC and, then, propose a robust nu -SvcPath, based on lower upper decomposition with partial pivoting. Theoretical analysis and experimental results verify that our proposed robust regularization path algorithm can avoid the exceptions completely, handle the singularities in the key matrix, and fit the entire solution path in a finite number of steps. Experimental results also show that our proposed algorithm fits the entire solution path with fewer steps and less running time than original one does.",4
A Note on the Unification of Adaptive Online Learning.,"In online convex optimization, adaptive algorithms, which can utilize the second-order information of the loss function's (sub)gradient, have shown improvements over standard gradient methods. This paper presents a framework Follow the Bregman Divergence Leader that unifies various existing adaptive algorithms from which new insights are revealed. Under the proposed framework, two simple adaptive online algorithms with improvable performance guarantee are derived. Furthermore, a general equation derived from a matrix analysis generalizes the adaptive learning to nonlinear case with kernel trick.",4
LIF and Simplified SRM Neurons Encode Signals Into Spikes via a Form of Asynchronous Pulse Sigma-Delta Modulation.,"We show how two spiking neuron models encode continuous-time signals into spikes (action potentials, time-encoded pulses, or point processes) using a special form of sigma-delta modulation (SDM). In particular, we show that the well-known leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron and the simplified spike response model (SRM0) neuron encode the continuous-time signals into spikes via a proposed asynchronous pulse SDM (APSDM) scheme. The encoder is clock free using level-crossing sampling with a single-level quantizer, unipolar signaling, differential coding, and pulse-shaping filters. The decoder, in the form of a low-pass filter or bandpass smoothing filter, can be fed with the spikes to reconstruct an estimate of the signal. The density of the spikes reflects the amplitude of the encoded signal. Numerical examples illustrating the concepts and the signaling efficiency of APSDM vis-a-vis SDM for comparable reconstruction accuracies are presented. We anticipate these results will facilitate the design of spiking neurons and spiking neural networks as well as cross fertilizations between the fields of neural coding and the SDM.",4
Modeling Disease Progression via Multisource Multitask Learners: A Case Study With Alzheimer's Disease.,"Understanding the progression of chronic diseases can empower the sufferers in taking proactive care. To predict the disease status in the future time points, various machine learning approaches have been proposed. However, a few of them jointly consider the dual heterogeneities of chronic disease progression. In particular, the predicting task at each time point has features from multiple sources, and multiple tasks are related to each other in chronological order. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel and unified scheme to coregularize the prior knowledge of source consistency and temporal smoothness. We theoretically prove that our proposed model is a linear model. Before training our model, we adopt the matrix factorization approach to address the data missing problem. Extensive evaluations on real-world Alzheimer's disease data set have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our model. It is worth mentioning that our model is generally applicable to a rich range of chronic diseases.",4
A Semisupervised Approach to the Detection and Characterization of Outliers in Categorical Data.,"In this paper, we introduce a new approach of semisupervised anomaly detection that deals with categorical data. Given a training set of instances (all belonging to the normal class), we analyze the relationship among features for the extraction of a discriminative characterization of the anomalous instances. Our key idea is to build a model that characterizes the features of the normal instances and then use a set of distance-based techniques for the discrimination between the normal and the anomalous instances. We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art methods for semisupervised anomaly detection. We empirically show that a specifically designed technique for the management of the categorical data outperforms the general-purpose approaches. We also show that, in contrast with other approaches that are opaque because their decision cannot be easily understood, our proposed approach produces a discriminative model that can be easily interpreted and used for the exploration of the data.",4
State Estimation for Discrete-Time Dynamical Networks With Time-Varying Delays and Stochastic Disturbances Under the Round-Robin Protocol.,"This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for a class of nonlinear dynamical networks with time-varying delays subject to the round-robin protocol. The communication between the state estimator and the nodes of the dynamical networks is implemented through a shared constrained network, in which only one node is allowed to send data at each time instant. The round-robin protocol is utilized to orchestrate the transmission order of nodes. By using a switch-based approach, the dynamics of the estimation error is modeled by a periodic parameter-switching system with time-varying delays. The purpose of the problem addressed is to design an estimator, such that the estimation error is exponentially ultimately bounded with a certain asymptotic upper bound in mean square subject to the process noise and exogenous disturbance. Furthermore, such a bound is subsequently minimized by the designed estimator parameters. A novel Lyapunov-like functional is employed to deal with the dynamics analysis issue of the estimation error. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the estimation error in mean square by applying the stochastic analysis approach. Then, the desired estimator gains are characterized by solving a convex problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the estimator design scheme.",4
Dual RBFNNs-Based Model-Free Adaptive Control With Aspen HYSYS Simulation.,"In this brief, we propose a new data-driven model-free adaptive control (MFAC) method with dual radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems. The main novelty lies in that it provides a systematic design method for controller structure by the direct usage of I/O data, rather than using the first-principle model or offline identified plant model. The controller structure is determined by equivalent-dynamic-linearization representation of the ideal nonlinear controller, and the controller parameters are tuned by the pseudogradient information extracted from the I/O data of the plant, which can deal with the unknown nonlinear system. The stability of the closed-loop control system and the stability of the training process for RBFNNs are guaranteed by rigorous theoretical analysis. Meanwhile, the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed method are further demonstrated by the numerical example and Aspen HYSYS simulation of distillation column in crude styrene produce process.",4
Event-Triggered State Estimation for Discrete-Time Multidelayed Neural Networks With Stochastic Parameters and Incomplete Measurements.,"In this paper, the event-triggered state estimation problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time multidelayed neural networks with stochastic parameters and incomplete measurements. In order to cater for more realistic transmission process of the neural signals, we make the first attempt to introduce a set of stochastic variables to characterize the random fluctuations of system parameters. In the addressed neural network model, the delays among the interconnections are allowed to be different, which are more general than those in the existing literature. The incomplete information under consideration includes randomly occurring sensor saturations and quantizations. For the purpose of energy saving, an event-triggered state estimator is constructed and a sufficient condition is given under which the estimation error dynamics is exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean square. It is worth noting that the ultimate boundedness of the error dynamics is explicitly estimated. The characterization of the desired estimator gain is designed in terms of the solution to a certain matrix inequality. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered state estimation scheme.",4
On Deep Learning for Trust-Aware Recommendations in Social Networks.,"With the emergence of online social networks, the social network-based recommendation approach is popularly used. The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.",4
"Affinity and Penalty Jointly Constrained Spectral Clustering With All-Compatibility, Flexibility, and Robustness.","The existing, semisupervised, spectral clustering approaches have two major drawbacks, i.e., either they cannot cope with multiple categories of supervision or they sometimes exhibit unstable effectiveness. To address these issues, two normalized affinity and penalty jointly constrained spectral clustering frameworks as well as their corresponding algorithms, referred to as type-I affinity and penalty jointly constrained spectral clustering (TI-APJCSC) and type-II affinity and penalty jointly constrained spectral clustering (TII-APJCSC), respectively, are proposed in this paper. TI refers to type-I and TII to type-II. The significance of this paper is fourfold. First, benefiting from the distinctive affinity and penalty jointly constrained strategies, both TI-APJCSC and TII-APJCSC are substantially more effective than the existing methods. Second, both TI-APJCSC and TII-APJCSC are fully compatible with the three well-known categories of supervision, i.e., class labels, pairwise constraints, and grouping information. Third, owing to the delicate framework normalization, both TI-APJCSC and TII-APJCSC are quite flexible. With a simple tradeoff factor varying in the small fixed interval (0, 1], they can self-adapt to any semisupervised scenario. Finally, both TI-APJCSC and TII-APJCSC demonstrate strong robustness, not only to the number of pairwise constraints but also to the parameter for affinity measurement. As such, the novel TI-APJCSC and TII-APJCSC algorithms are very practical for medium- and small-scale semisupervised data sets. The experimental studies thoroughly evaluated and demonstrated these advantages on both synthetic and real-life semisupervised data sets.",4
Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Single-Image Super-Resolution.,"This paper develops a coarse-to-fine framework for single-image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction. The coarse-to-fine approach achieves high-quality SR recovery based on the complementary properties of both example learning-and reconstruction-based algorithms: example learning-based SR approaches are useful for generating plausible details from external exemplars but poor at suppressing aliasing artifacts, while reconstruction-based SR methods are propitious for preserving sharp edges yet fail to generate fine details. In the coarse stage of the method, we use a set of simple yet effective mapping functions, learned via correlative neighbor regression of grouped low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) dictionary atoms, to synthesize an initial SR estimate with particularly low computational cost. In the fine stage, we devise an effective regularization term that seamlessly integrates the properties of local structural regularity, nonlocal self-similarity, and collaborative representation over relevant atoms in a learned HR dictionary, to further improve the visual quality of the initial SR estimation obtained in the coarse stage. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for producing high-quality images despite that both the initial SR estimation and the followed enhancement are cheap to implement.",4
Learning Discriminative Subspaces on Random Contrasts for Image Saliency Analysis.,"In visual saliency estimation, one of the most challenging tasks is to distinguish targets and distractors that share certain visual attributes. With the observation that such targets and distractors can sometimes be easily separated when projected to specific subspaces, we propose to estimate image saliency by learning a set of discriminative subspaces that perform the best in popping out targets and suppressing distractors. Toward this end, we first conduct principal component analysis on massive randomly selected image patches. The principal components, which correspond to the largest eigenvalues, are selected to construct candidate subspaces since they often demonstrate impressive abilities to separate targets and distractors. By projecting images onto various subspaces, we further characterize each image patch by its contrasts against randomly selected neighboring and peripheral regions. In this manner, the probable targets often have the highest responses, while the responses at background regions become very low. Based on such random contrasts, an optimization framework with pairwise binary terms is adopted to learn the saliency model that best separates salient targets and distractors by optimally integrating the cues from various subspaces. Experimental results on two public benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms 16 state-of-the-art methods in human fixation prediction.",4
Learning Kernel Extended Dictionary for Face Recognition.,"A sparse representation classifier (SRC) and a kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) are two successful methods for face recognition. An SRC is good at dealing with occlusion, while a KDA does well in suppressing intraclass variations. In this paper, we propose kernel extended dictionary (KED) for face recognition, which provides an efficient way for combining KDA and SRC. We first learn several kernel principal components of occlusion variations as an occlusion model, which can represent the possible occlusion variations efficiently. Then, the occlusion model is projected by KDA to get the KED, which can be computed via the same kernel trick as new testing samples. Finally, we use structured SRC for classification, which is fast as only a small number of atoms are appended to the basic dictionary, and the feature dimension is low. We also extend KED to multikernel space to fuse different types of features at kernel level. Experiments are done on several large-scale data sets, demonstrating that not only does KED get impressive results for nonoccluded samples, but it also handles the occlusion well without overfitting, even with a single gallery sample per subject.",4
Deep Neural Network for Structural Prediction and Lane Detection in Traffic Scene.,"Hierarchical neural networks have been shown to be effective in learning representative image features and recognizing object classes. However, most existing networks combine the low/middle level cues for classification without accounting for any spatial structures. For applications such as understanding a scene, how the visual cues are spatially distributed in an image becomes essential for successful analysis. This paper extends the framework of deep neural networks by accounting for the structural cues in the visual signals. In particular, two kinds of neural networks have been proposed. First, we develop a multitask deep convolutional network, which simultaneously detects the presence of the target and the geometric attributes (location and orientation) of the target with respect to the region of interest. Second, a recurrent neuron layer is adopted for structured visual detection. The recurrent neurons can deal with the spatial distribution of visible cues belonging to an object whose shape or structure is difficult to explicitly define. Both the networks are demonstrated by the practical task of detecting lane boundaries in traffic scenes. The multitask convolutional neural network provides auxiliary geometric information to help the subsequent modeling of the given lane structures. The recurrent neural network automatically detects lane boundaries, including those areas containing no marks, without any explicit prior knowledge or secondary modeling.",4
Deep Direct Reinforcement Learning for Financial Signal Representation and Trading.,"Can we train the computer to beat experienced traders for financial assert trading? In this paper, we try to address this challenge by introducing a recurrent deep neural network (NN) for real-time financial signal representation and trading. Our model is inspired by two biological-related learning concepts of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the framework, the DL part automatically senses the dynamic market condition for informative feature learning. Then, the RL module interacts with deep representations and makes trading decisions to accumulate the ultimate rewards in an unknown environment. The learning system is implemented in a complex NN that exhibits both the deep and recurrent structures. Hence, we propose a task-aware backpropagation through time method to cope with the gradient vanishing issue in deep training. The robustness of the neural system is verified on both the stock and the commodity future markets under broad testing conditions.",4
Mixtures of Conditional Random Fields for Improved Structured Output Prediction.,"The conditional random field (CRF) is a successful probabilistic model for structured output prediction problems. In this brief, we consider to enlarge the representational capacity of CRF via mixture modeling. The motivation is that a single CRF can perform well if the data conform to the statistical dependence assumption imposed by the CRF model structure, whereas it may potentially fail to model the data that come from multiple different sources or domains. For the conventional conditional likelihood objective, we derive the expectation-maximization algorithm in conjunction with the direct gradient ascent method for learning a CRF mixture with sequence or image-structured data. In addition, we provide alternative mixture learning algorithms that aim to maximize either the classification margin or the sitewise conditional likelihood, which were previously shown to outperform the conventional estimator for single CRF models in a variety of situations. We demonstrate the improved prediction accuracy of the proposed mixture learning algorithms on several important sequence labeling problems.",4
Robust Recurrent Kernel Online Learning.,"We propose a robust recurrent kernel online learning (RRKOL) algorithm based on the celebrated real-time recurrent learning approach that exploits the kernel trick in a recurrent online training manner. The novel RRKOL algorithm guarantees weight convergence with regularized risk management through the use of adaptive recurrent hyperparameters for superior generalization performance. Based on a new concept of the structure update error with a variable parameter length, we are the first one to propose the detailed structure update error, such that the weight convergence and robust stability proof can be integrated with a kernel sparsification scheme based on a solid theoretical ground. The RRKOL algorithm automatically weighs the regularized term in the recurrent loss function, such that we not only minimize the estimation error but also improve the generalization performance through sparsification with simulation support.",4
High-Performance Consensus Control in Networked Systems With Limited Bandwidth Communication and Time-Varying Directed Topologies.,"Communication data rates and energy constraints are two important factors that have to be considered in the coordination control of multiagent networks. Although some encoder-decoder-based consensus protocols are available, there still exists a fundamental theoretical problem: how can we further reduce the update rate of control input for each agent without the changing consensus performance? In this paper, we consider the problem of average consensus over directed and time-varying digital networks of discrete-time first-order multiagent systems with limited communication data transmission rates. Each agent has a real-valued state but can only exchange binary symbolic sequence with its neighbors due to bandwidth constraints. A class of novel event-triggered dynamic encoding and decoding algorithms is proposed, based on which a kind of consensus protocol is presented. Moreover, we develop a scheme to select the numbers of time-varying quantization levels for each connected communication channel in the time-varying directed topologies at each time step. The analytical relation among system and network parameters is characterized explicitly. It is shown that the asymptotic convergence rate is related to the scale of the network, the number of quantization levels, the system parameter, and the network structure. It is also found that under the designed event-triggered protocol, for a directed and time-varying digital network, which uniformly contains a spanning tree over a time interval, the average consensus can be achieved with an exponential convergence rate based on merely 1-b information exchange between each pair of adjacent agents at each time step.",4
Pinning Impulsive Synchronization of Reaction-Diffusion Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays.,"This paper investigates the exponential synchronization of reaction-diffusion neural networks with time-varying delays subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. A novel type of pinning impulsive controllers is proposed to synchronize the reaction-diffusion neural networks with time-varying delays. By applying the Lyapunov functional method, sufficient verifiable conditions are constructed for the exponential synchronization of delayed reaction-diffusion neural networks with large and small delay sizes. It is shown that synchronization can be realized by pinning impulsive control of a small portion of neurons of the network; the technique used in this paper is also applicable to reaction-diffusion networks with Neumann boundary conditions. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",4
Max-Margin-Based Discriminative Feature Learning.,"In this brief, we propose a new max-margin-based discriminative feature learning method. In particular, we aim at learning a low-dimensional feature representation, so as to maximize the global margin of the data and make the samples from the same class as close as possible. In order to enhance the robustness to noise, we leverage a regularization term to make the transformation matrix sparse in rows. In addition, we further learn and leverage the correlations among multiple categories for assisting in learning discriminative features. The experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed method against the related state-of-the-art methods.",4
Scalable Algorithms for Multi-Instance Learning.,"Multi-instance learning (MIL) has been widely applied to diverse applications involving complicated data objects, such as images and genes. However, most existing MIL algorithms can only handle small- or moderate-sized data. In order to deal with large-scale MIL problems, we propose MIL based on the vector of locally aggregated descriptors representation (miVLAD) and MIL based on the Fisher vector representation (miFV), two efficient and scalable MIL algorithms. They map the original MIL bags into new vector representations using their corresponding mapping functions. The new feature representations keep essential bag-level information, and at the same time lead to excellent MIL performances even when linear classifiers are used. Thanks to the low computational cost in the mapping step and the scalability of linear classifiers, miVLAD and miFV can handle large-scale MIL data efficiently and effectively. Experiments show that miVLAD and miFV not only achieve comparable accuracy rates with the state-of-the-art MIL algorithms, but also have hundreds of times faster speed. Moreover, we can regard the new miVLAD and miFV representations as multiview data, which improves the accuracy rates in most cases. In addition, our algorithms perform well even when they are used without parameter tuning (i.e., adopting the default parameters), which is convenient for practical MIL applications.",4
An Adaptable Continuous Restricted Boltzmann Machine in VLSI for Fusing the Sensory Data of an Electronic Nose.,"An embedded system capable of fusing sensory data is demanded for many portable or implantable microsystems. The continuous restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) is a probabilistic neural network not only capable of classifying data reliably but also amenable to very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) implementation. Although the embedded system based on the CRBM has been demonstrated with analog VLSI, the precision required by the learning algorithm is hardly achievable with analog circuits. Therefore, this paper investigates the feasibility of realizing the CRBM as a digital embedded system for fusing the sensory data of an electronic nose (eNose). The fusion here refers to data clustering and dimensional reduction that facilitates reliable classification. The capability of the CRBM to model different types of eNose data is first examined by MATLAB simulation. Afterward, the CRBM algorithm is customdesigned as a digital embedded system within an eNose microsystem. The functionality of the embedded CRBM system is then tested and discussed. With on-chip learning ability, the CRBM-embedded eNose is able to adapt its parameters in response to new data inputs or environmental changes.",4
Air-Breathing Hypersonic Vehicle Tracking Control Based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming.,"In this paper, we propose a data-driven supplementary control approach with adaptive learning capability for air-breathing hypersonic vehicle tracking control based on action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming (ADHDP). The control action is generated by the combination of sliding mode control (SMC) and the ADHDP controller to track the desired velocity and the desired altitude. In particular, the ADHDP controller observes the differences between the actual velocity/altitude and the desired velocity/altitude, and then provides a supplementary control action accordingly. The ADHDP controller does not rely on the accurate mathematical model function and is data driven. Meanwhile, it is capable to adjust its parameters online over time under various working conditions, which is very suitable for hypersonic vehicle system with parameter uncertainties and disturbances. We verify the adaptive supplementary control approach versus the traditional SMC in the cruising flight, and provide three simulation studies to illustrate the improved performance with the proposed approach.",4
Multiscale Support Vector Learning With Projection Operator Wavelet Kernel for Nonlinear Dynamical System Identification.,"A giant leap has been made in the past couple of decades with the introduction of kernel-based learning as a mainstay for designing effective nonlinear computational learning algorithms. In view of the geometric interpretation of conditional expectation and the ubiquity of multiscale characteristics in highly complex nonlinear dynamic systems [1]-[3], this paper presents a new orthogonal projection operator wavelet kernel, aiming at developing an efficient computational learning approach for nonlinear dynamical system identification. In the framework of multiresolution analysis, the proposed projection operator wavelet kernel can fulfill the multiscale, multidimensional learning to estimate complex dependencies. The special advantage of the projection operator wavelet kernel developed in this paper lies in the fact that it has a closed-form expression, which greatly facilitates its application in kernel learning. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first closed-form orthogonal projection wavelet kernel reported in the literature. It provides a link between grid-based wavelets and mesh-free kernel-based methods. Simulation studies for identifying the parallel models of two benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems confirm its superiority in model accuracy and sparsity.",4
Speeding Up Cellular Neural Network Processing Ability by Embodying Memristors.,"Cellular neural networks (CNNs) are an efficient tool for image analysis and pattern recognition. Based on elementary cells connected to neighboring units, they are easy to install in hardware, carrying out massively parallel processes. This brief presents a new model of CNN with memory devices, which enhances further CNN performance. By introducing a memristive element in basic cells, we carry out different experiments, allowing the analysis of the functions traditionally carried out by the standard CNN. Without modifying the templates considered by the scientific literature, this simple variation originates a significant improvement in approximately 30 % of performances in pattern recognition and image processing. These progresses were experimentally calculated on the time the system requires to reach a fixed point. Moreover, the different role that each parameter has in the developed method was also analyzed to better understand the complex processing ability of these systems.",4
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Horizon Approximate Optimal Tracking.,"This brief paper provides an approximate online adaptive solution to the infinite-horizon optimal tracking problem for control-affine continuous-time nonlinear systems with unknown drift dynamics. To relax the persistence of excitation condition, model-based reinforcement learning is implemented using a concurrent-learning-based system identifier to simulate experience by evaluating the Bellman error over unexplored areas of the state space. Tracking of the desired trajectory and convergence of the developed policy to a neighborhood of the optimal policy are established via Lyapunov-based stability analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique.",4
An Optimization-Based Method for Feature Ranking in Nonlinear Regression Problems.,"In this paper, we consider the feature ranking problem, where, given a set of training instances, the task is to associate a score with the features in order to assess their relevance. Feature ranking is a very important tool for decision support systems, and may be used as an auxiliary step of feature selection to reduce the high dimensionality of real-world data. We focus on regression problems by assuming that the process underlying the generated data can be approximated by a continuous function (for instance, a feedforward neural network). We formally state the notion of relevance of a feature by introducing a minimum zero-norm inversion problem of a neural network, which is a nonsmooth, constrained optimization problem. We employ a concave approximation of the zero-norm function, and we define a smooth, global optimization problem to be solved in order to assess the relevance of the features. We present the new feature ranking method based on the solution of instances of the global optimization problem depending on the available training data. Computational experiments on both artificial and real data sets are performed, and point out that the proposed feature ranking method is a valid alternative to existing methods in terms of effectiveness. The obtained results also show that the method is costly in terms of CPU time, and this may be a limitation in the solution of large-dimensional problems.",4
An Integrated Learning and Filtering Approach for Fault Diagnosis of a Class of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems.,"This paper develops an integrated filtering and adaptive approximation-based approach for fault diagnosis of process and sensor faults in a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems with modeling uncertainties and measurement noise. The proposed approach integrates learning with filtering techniques to derive tight detection thresholds, which is accomplished in two ways: 1) by learning the modeling uncertainty through adaptive approximation methods and 2) by using filtering for dampening measurement noise. Upon the detection of a fault, two estimation models, one for process and the other for sensor faults, are initiated in order to identify the type of fault. Each estimation model utilizes learning to estimate the potential fault that has occurred, and adaptive isolation thresholds for each estimation model are designed. The fault type is deduced based on an exclusion-based logic, and fault detectability and identification conditions are rigorously derived, characterizing quantitatively the class of faults that can be detected and identified by the proposed scheme. Finally, simulation results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",4
Symmetric Complex-Valued Hopfield Neural Networks.,"Complex-valued neural networks, which are extensions of ordinary neural networks, have been studied as interesting models by many researchers. Especially, complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CHNNs) have been used to process multilevel data, such as gray-scale images. CHNNs with Hermitian connection weights always converge using asynchronous update. The noise tolerance of CHNNs deteriorates extremely as the resolution increases. Noise tolerance is one of the most controversial problems for CHNNs. It is known that rotational invariance reduces noise tolerance. In this brief, we propose symmetric CHNNs (SCHNNs), which have symmetric connection weights. We define their energy function and prove that the SCHNNs always converge. In addition, we show that the SCHNNs improve noise tolerance through computer simulations and explain this improvement from the standpoint of rotational invariance.",4
Adaptive Method for Nonsmooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.,"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is an emerging tool for meaningful low-rank matrix representation. In NMF, explicit constraints are usually required, such that NMF generates desired products (or factorizations), especially when the products have significant sparseness features. It is known that the ability of NMF in learning sparse representation can be improved by embedding a smoothness factor between the products. Motivated by this result, we propose an adaptive nonsmooth NMF (Ans-NMF) method in this paper. In our method, the embedded factor is obtained by using a data-related approach, so it matches well with the underlying products, implying a superior faithfulness of the representations. Besides, due to the usage of an adaptive selection scheme to this factor, the sparseness of the products can be separately constrained, leading to wider applicability and interpretability. Furthermore, since the adaptive selection scheme is processed through solving a series of typical linear programming problems, it can be easily implemented. Simulations using computer-generated data and real-world data show the advantages of the proposed Ans-NMF method over the state-of-the-art methods.",4
Learning in Variable-Dimensional Spaces.,"This paper proposes a unified approach to learning in environments in which patterns can be represented in variable-dimension domains, which nicely includes the case in which there are missing features. The proposal is based on the representation of the environment by pointwise constraints that are shown to model naturally pattern relationships that come out in problems of information retrieval, computer vision, and related fields. The given interpretation of learning leads to capturing the truly different aspects of similarity coming from the content at different dimensions and the pattern links. It turns out that functions that process real-valued features and functions that operate on symbolic entities are learned within a unified framework of regularization that can also be expressed using the kernel machines mathematical and algorithmic apparatus. Interestingly, in the extreme cases in which only the content or only the links are available, our theory returns classic kernel machines or graph regularization, respectively. We show experimental results that provide clear evidence of the remarkable improvements that are obtained when both types of similarities are exploited on artificial and real-world benchmarks.",4
Triplet Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity in a Floating-Gate Synapse.,"Synapse plays an important role in learning in a neural network; the learning rules that modify the synaptic strength based on the timing difference between the pre- and postsynaptic spike occurrence are termed spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules. The most commonly used rule posits weight change based on time difference between one presynaptic spike and one postsynaptic spike and is hence termed doublet STDP (D-STDP). However, D-STDP could not reproduce results of many biological experiments; a triplet STDP (T-STDP) that considers triplets of spikes as the fundamental unit has been proposed recently to explain these observations. This paper describes the compact implementation of a synapse using a single floating-gate (FG) transistor that can store a weight in a nonvolatile manner and demonstrates the T-STDP learning rule by modifying drain voltages according to triplets of spikes. We describe a mathematical procedure to obtain control voltages for the FG device for T-STDP and also show measurement results from an FG synapse fabricated in TSMC 0.35-mum CMOS process to support the theory. Possible very large scale integration implementation of drain voltage waveform generator circuits is also presented with the simulation results.",4
Sparse Principal Component Analysis via Rotation and Truncation.,"Sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA) aims at finding a sparse basis to improve the interpretability over the dense basis of PCA, while still covering the data subspace as much as possible. In contrast to most existing work that addresses the problem by adding sparsity penalties on various objectives of PCA, we propose a new method, sparse PCA via rotation and truncation (SPCArt), which finds a rotation matrix and a sparse basis such that the sparse basis approximates the basis of PCA after the rotation. The algorithm of SPCArt consists of three alternating steps: 1) rotating the PCA basis; 2) truncating small entries; and 3) updating the rotation matrix. Its performance bounds are also given. The SPCArt is efficient, with each iteration scaling linearly with the data dimension. Parameter choice is simple, due to explicit physical explanations. We give a unified view to several existing sparse PCA methods and discuss the connections with SPCArt. Some ideas from SPCArt are extended to GPower, a popular sparse PCA algorithm, to address its limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPCArt achieves the state-of-the-art performance, along with a good tradeoff among various criteria, including sparsity, explained variance, orthogonality, balance of sparsity among loadings, and computational speed.",4
Cross-Modality Feature Learning Through Generic Hierarchical Hyperlingual-Words.,"Recognizing facial images captured under visible light has long been discussed in the past decades. However, there are many impact factors that hinder its successful application in real-world, e.g., illumination, pose variations. Recent work has concentrated on different spectrals, i.e., near infrared, that can only be perceived by specifically designed device to avoid the illumination problem. However, this inevitably introduces a new problem, namely, cross-modality classification. In brief, images registered in the system are in one modality, while images that captured momentarily used as the tests are in another modality. In addition, there could be many within-modality variations-pose and expression-leading to a more complicated problem for the researchers. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called hierarchical hyperlingual-words (Hwords) in this paper. First, we design a novel structure, called generic Hwords, to capture the high-level semantics across different modalities and within each modality in weakly supervised fashion, meaning only modality pair and variations information are needed in the training. Second, to improve the discriminative power of Hwords, we propose a novel distance metric through the hierarchical structure of Hwords. Extensive experiments on multimodality face databases demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art works on face recognition tasks subject to pose and expression variations.",4
Identification of Boolean Networks Using Premined Network Topology Information.,"This brief aims to reduce the data requirement for the identification of Boolean networks (BNs) by using the premined network topology information. First, a matching table is created and used for sifting the true from the false dependences among the nodes in the BNs. Then, a dynamic extension to matching table is developed to enable the dynamic locating of matching pairs to start as soon as possible. Next, based on the pseudocommutative property of the semitensor product, a position-transform mining is carried out to further improve data utilization. Combining the above, the topology of the BNs can be premined for the subsequent identification. Examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of reducing the data requirement. Some excellent features, such as the online and parallel processing ability, are also demonstrated.",4
A Maximum Entropy Framework for Semisupervised and Active Learning With Unknown and Label-Scarce Classes.,"We investigate semisupervised learning (SL) and pool-based active learning (AL) of a classifier for domains with label-scarce (LS) and unknown categories, i.e., defined categories for which there are initially no labeled examples. This scenario manifests, e.g., when a category is rare, or expensive to label. There are several learning issues when there are unknown categories: 1) it is a priori unknown which subset of (possibly many) measured features are needed to discriminate unknown from common classes and 2) label scarcity suggests that overtraining is a concern. Our classifier exploits the inductive bias that an unknown class consists of the subset of the unlabeled pool's samples that are atypical (relative to the common classes) with respect to certain key (albeit a priori unknown) features and feature interactions. Accordingly, we treat negative log- p -values on raw features as nonnegatively weighted derived feature inputs to our class posterior, with zero weights identifying irrelevant features. Through a hierarchical class posterior, our model accommodates multiple common classes, multiple LS classes, and unknown classes. For learning, we propose a novel semisupervised objective customized for the LS/unknown category scenarios. While several works minimize class decision uncertainty on unlabeled samples, we instead preserve this uncertainty [maximum entropy (maxEnt)] to avoid overtraining. Our experiments on a variety of UCI Machine learning (ML) domains show: 1) the use of p -value features coupled with weight constraints leads to sparse solutions and gives significant improvement over the use of raw features and 2) for LS SL and AL, unlabeled samples are helpful, and should be used to preserve decision uncertainty (maxEnt), rather than to minimize it, especially during the early stages of AL. Our AL system, leveraging a novel sample-selection scheme, discovers unknown classes and discriminates LS classes from common ones, with sparing use of oracle labeling.",4
Machine Learning Capabilities of a Simulated Cerebellum.,"This paper describes the learning and control capabilities of a biologically constrained bottom-up model of the mammalian cerebellum. Results are presented from six tasks: 1) eyelid conditioning; 2) pendulum balancing; 3) proportional-integral-derivative control; 4) robot balancing; 5) pattern recognition; and 6) MNIST handwritten digit recognition. These tasks span several paradigms of machine learning, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, control, and pattern recognition. Results over these six domains indicate that the cerebellar simulation is capable of robustly identifying static input patterns even when randomized across the sensory apparatus. This capability allows the simulated cerebellum to perform several different supervised learning and control tasks. On the other hand, both reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition prove problematic due to the delayed nature of error signals and the simulator's inability to solve the credit assignment problem. These results are consistent with previous findings which hypothesize that in the human brain, the basal ganglia is responsible for reinforcement learning, while the cerebellum handles supervised learning.",4
Manifold-Based Reinforcement Learning via Locally Linear Reconstruction.,"Feature representation is critical not only for pattern recognition tasks but also for reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve learning control problems under uncertainties. In this paper, a manifold-based RL approach using the principle of locally linear reconstruction (LLR) is proposed for Markov decision processes with large or continuous state spaces. In the proposed approach, an LLR-based feature learning scheme is developed for value function approximation in RL, where a set of smooth feature vectors is generated by preserving the local approximation properties of neighboring points in the original state space. By using the proposed feature learning scheme, an LLR-based approximate policy iteration (API) algorithm is designed for learning control problems with large or continuous state spaces. The relationship between the value approximation error of a new data point and the estimated values of its nearest neighbors is analyzed. In order to compare different feature representation and learning approaches for RL, a comprehensive simulation and experimental study was conducted on three benchmark learning control problems. It is illustrated that under a wide range of parameter settings, the LLR-based API algorithm can obtain better learning control performance than the previous API methods with different feature representation schemes.",4
Distributed Recurrent Neural Networks for Cooperative Control of Manipulators: A Game-Theoretic Perspective.,"This paper considers cooperative kinematic control of multiple manipulators using distributed recurrent neural networks and provides a tractable way to extend existing results on individual manipulator control using recurrent neural networks to the scenario with the coordination of multiple manipulators. The problem is formulated as a constrained game, where energy consumptions for each manipulator, saturations of control input, and the topological constraints imposed by the communication graph are considered. An implicit form of the Nash equilibrium for the game is obtained by converting the problem into its dual space. Then, a distributed dynamic controller based on recurrent neural networks is devised to drive the system toward the desired Nash equilibrium to seek the optimal solution of the cooperative control. Global stability and solution optimality of the proposed neural networks are proved in the theory. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
High-Order Measurements for Residual Classifiers.,"Residual classifiers are common in dictionary-based multiclass classification. This paper proposes the concept of performance functions for residual classifiers. A performance function for multiclass classifications is a conceptual measurement function that combines local and global measurements. In general, the performance function is nonlinear. To explore the properties of the performance function, we employ the Taylor series expansion technique and derive a family of measurement functions. Specifically, the linear measurement and the quadratic measurement (QM) are derived. By exploiting the effect of the higher order terms in the performance function as well as the fundamental nondecreasing constrain, we derive the normalized QM (NQM). We present the classifier for multiclass classification using the proposed measurements. The proposed algorithms are tested against frontal faces and handwritten digit recognition tasks. Our tests show that the QM classifier achieves competitive classification results compared with baseline methods. NQM shows better stability with different parameter configurations.",4
Graph Theory-Based Pinning Synchronization of Stochastic Complex Dynamical Networks.,"This paper is concerned with the adaptive pinning synchronization problem of stochastic complex dynamical networks (CDNs). Based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov theory, pinning controller design conditions are derived, and the rigorous convergence analysis of synchronization errors in the probability sense is also conducted. Compared with the existing results, the topology structures of stochastic CDN are allowed to be unknown due to the use of graph theory. In particular, it is shown that the selection of nodes for pinning depends on the unknown lower bounds of coupling strengths. Finally, an example on a Chua's circuit network is given to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",4
Learning a Coupled Linearized Method in Online Setting.,"Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, in this paper, we propose, analyze, and test a coupled linearized method, which aims to minimize an unconstrained problem consisting of a loss term and a regularization term in an online setting. To solve this problem, we first transform it into an equivalent constrained minimization problem with a separable structure. Then, we split the corresponding augmented Lagrangian function and minimize the resulting subproblems distributedly with one variable by fixing another one. This method is easy to execute without calculating matrix inversion by implementing three linearized operations per iteration, and at each iteration, we can obtain a closed-form solution. In particular, our update rule contains the well-known soft-thresholding operator as a special case. Moreover, upper bound on the regret of the proposed method is analyzed. Under some mild conditions, it can achieve O(1/ radicalT) convergence rate for convex learning problems and O((log T)/ T) for strongly convex learning. Numerical experiments and comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods are reported, which demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",4
A Scoring Scheme for Online Feature Selection: Simulating Model Performance Without Retraining.,"Increasing the number of features increases the complexity of a model even if the additional feature does not improve its decision-making capacity. Irrelevant features may also cause overfitting and reduce interpretability of the concerned model. It is, therefore, important that the features are optimally selected before a model is built. In the case of online learning, new instances are periodically discovered, and the respective model is tactically retrained as required. Similarly, there are many real-life situations where hundreds of new features are discovered periodically, and the existing model needs to be retrained or tested for its performance improvement. Supervised selection of feature subset usually requires creation of multiple suboptimal models, thus incurring time-intensive computations. Unsupervised selections, although faster, largely rely on some subjective definition of feature relevance. In this paper, we introduce a score that accurately determines the importance of the features. The proposed score is appropriate for online feature selection scenarios for its low time complexity and ability to interpret performance improvement of the current model after the addition of a new feature, without invoking a retraining.",4
Impulsive Synchronization of Reaction-Diffusion Neural Networks With Mixed Delays and Its Application to Image Encryption.,"This paper presents a new impulsive synchronization criterion of two identical reaction-diffusion neural networks with discrete and unbounded distributed delays. The new criterion is established by applying an impulse-time-dependent Lyapunov functional combined with the use of a new type of integral inequality for treating the reaction-diffusion terms. The impulse-time-dependent feature of the proposed Lyapunov functional can capture more hybrid dynamical behaviors of the impulsive reaction-diffusion neural networks than the conventional impulse-time-independent Lyapunov functions/functionals, while the new integral inequality, which is derived from Wirtinger's inequality, overcomes the conservatism introduced by the integral inequality used in the previous results. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Later, the developed impulsive synchronization method is applied to build a spatiotemporal chaotic cryptosystem that can transmit an encrypted image. The experimental results verify that the proposed image-encrypting cryptosystem has the advantages of large key space and high security against some traditional attacks.",4
Nonparametric Density Estimation Based on Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network for Large Noisy Data.,"With the ongoing development and expansion of communication networks and sensors, massive amounts of data are continuously generated in real time from real environments. Beforehand, prediction of a distribution underlying such data is difficult; furthermore, the data include substantial amounts of noise. These factors make it difficult to estimate probability densities. To handle these issues and massive amounts of data, we propose a nonparametric density estimator that rapidly learns data online and has high robustness. Our approach is an extension of both kernel density estimation (KDE) and a self-organizing incremental neural network (SOINN); therefore, we call our approach KDESOINN. An SOINN provides a clustering method that learns about the given data as networks of prototype of data; more specifically, an SOINN can learn the distribution underlying the given data. Using this information, KDESOINN estimates the probability density function. The results of our experiments show that KDESOINN outperforms or achieves performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of robustness, learning time, and accuracy.",4
Dynamic Energy Management System for a Smart Microgrid.,"This paper presents the development of an intelligent dynamic energy management system (I-DEMS) for a smart microgrid. An evolutionary adaptive dynamic programming and reinforcement learning framework is introduced for evolving the I-DEMS online. The I-DEMS is an optimal or near-optimal DEMS capable of performing grid-connected and islanded microgrid operations. The primary sources of energy are sustainable, green, and environmentally friendly renewable energy systems (RESs), e.g., wind and solar; however, these forms of energy are uncertain and nondispatchable. Backup battery energy storage and thermal generation were used to overcome these challenges. Using the I-DEMS to schedule dispatches allowed the RESs and energy storage devices to be utilized to their maximum in order to supply the critical load at all times. Based on the microgrid's system states, the I-DEMS generates energy dispatch control signals, while a forward-looking network evaluates the dispatched control signals over time. Typical results are presented for varying generation and load profiles, and the performance of I-DEMS is compared with that of a decision tree approach-based DEMS (D-DEMS). The robust performance of the I-DEMS was illustrated by examining microgrid operations under different battery energy storage conditions.",4
Growing Echo-State Network With Multiple Subreservoirs.,"An echo-state network (ESN) is an effective alternative to gradient methods for training recurrent neural network. However, it is difficult to determine the structure (mainly the reservoir) of the ESN to match with the given application. In this paper, a growing ESN (GESN) is proposed to design the size and topology of the reservoir automatically. First, the GESN makes use of the block matrix theory to add hidden units to the existing reservoir group by group, which leads to a GESN with multiple subreservoirs. Second, every subreservoir weight matrix in the GESN is created with a predefined singular value spectrum, which ensures the echo-sate property of the ESN without posterior scaling of the weights. Third, during the growth of the network, the output weights of the GESN are updated in an incremental way. Moreover, the convergence of the GESN is proved. Finally, the GESN is tested on some artificial and real-world time-series benchmarks. Simulation results show that the proposed GESN has better prediction performance and faster leaning speed than some ESNs with fixed sizes and topologies.",4
Bottom-Up Visual Saliency Estimation With Deep Autoencoder-Based Sparse Reconstruction.,"Research on visual perception indicates that the human visual system is sensitive to center-surround (C-S) contrast in the bottom-up saliency-driven attention process. Different from the traditional contrast computation of feature difference, models based on reconstruction have emerged to estimate saliency by starting from original images themselves instead of seeking for certain ad hoc features. However, in the existing reconstruction-based methods, the reconstruction parameters of each area are calculated independently without taking their global correlation into account. In this paper, inspired by the powerful feature learning and data reconstruction ability of deep autoencoders, we construct a deep C-S inference network and train it with the data sampled randomly from the entire image to obtain a unified reconstruction pattern for the current image. In this way, global competition in sampling and learning processes can be integrated into the nonlocal reconstruction and saliency estimation of each pixel, which can achieve better detection results than the models with separate consideration on local and global rarity. Moreover, by learning from the current scene, the proposed model can achieve the feature extraction and interaction simultaneously in an adaptive way, which can form a better generalization ability to handle more types of stimuli. Experimental results show that in accordance with different inputs, the network can learn distinct basic features for saliency modeling in its code layer. Furthermore, in a comprehensive evaluation on several benchmark data sets, the proposed method can outperform the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.",4
Hierarchical Change-Detection Tests.,"We present hierarchical change-detection tests (HCDTs), as effective online algorithms for detecting changes in datastreams. HCDTs are characterized by a hierarchical architecture composed of a detection layer and a validation layer. The detection layer steadily analyzes the input datastream by means of an online, sequential CDT, which operates as a low-complexity trigger that promptly detects possible changes in the process generating the data. The validation layer is activated when the detection one reveals a change, and performs an offline, more sophisticated analysis on recently acquired data to reduce false alarms. Our experiments show that, when the process generating the datastream is unknown, as it is mostly the case in the real world, HCDTs achieve a far more advantageous tradeoff between false-positive rate and detection delay than their single-layered, more traditional counterpart. Moreover, the successful interplay between the two layers permits HCDTs to automatically reconfigure after having detected and validated a change. Thus, HCDTs are able to reveal further departures from the postchange state of the data-generating process.",4
QRNN: $q$ -Generalized Random Neural Network.,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in applications with complex decision boundaries. A large number of activation functions have been proposed in the literature to achieve better representations of the observed data. However, only a few works employ Tsallis statistics, which has successfully been applied to various other fields. This paper presents a random neural network (RNN) with q -Gaussian activation functions [ q -generalized RNN (QRNN)] based on Tsallis statistics. The proposed method employs an additional parameter q (called the entropic index) which reflects the degree of nonextensivity. This approach has the flexibility to model complex decision boundaries of different shapes by varying the entropic index. We conduct numerical experiments to analyze the efficiency of QRNN compared with RNNs and several other classical methods. Statistical tests (Wilcoxon and Friedman) are used to validate our results and show that the QRNN performs significantly better than RNNs with different activation functions. In addition, we find that QRNN outperforms many of the compared classical methods, with the exception of support vector machines, in which case it still exhibits a substantial advantage in terms of implementation simplicity and speed.",4
A Novel Twin Support-Vector Machine With Pinball Loss.,"Twin support-vector machine (TSVM), which generates two nonparallel hyperplanes by solving a pair of smaller-sized quadratic programming problems (QPPs) instead of a single larger-sized QPP, works faster than the standard SVM, especially for the large-scale data sets. However, the traditional TSVM adopts hinge loss which easily leads to its sensitivity of the noise and instability for resampling. To enhance the performance of the TSVM, we present a novel TSVM with the pinball loss (Pin-TSVM) which deals with the quantile distance and is less sensitive to noise points. We further investigate its properties, including the noise insensitivity, between-class distance maximization, and within-class scatter minimization. In addition, we compare our Pin-TSVM with the twin parametric-margin SVM and the SVM with the pinball loss in theory. Numerical experiments on a synthetic data set and 14 benchmark data sets with different noises demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our proposed method.",4
Image Super-Resolution via Adaptive Regularization and Sparse Representation.,"Previous studies have shown that image patches can be well represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately selected over-complete dictionary. Recently, single-image super-resolution (SISR) via sparse representation using blurred and downsampled low-resolution images has attracted increasing interest, where the aim is to obtain the coefficients for sparse representation by solving an l0 or l1 norm optimization problem. The l0 optimization is a nonconvex and NP-hard problem, while the l1 optimization usually requires many more measurements and presents new challenges even when the image is the usual size, so we propose a new approach for SISR recovery based on regularization nonconvex optimization. The proposed approach is potentially a powerful method for recovering SISR via sparse representations, and it can yield a sparser solution than the l1 regularization method. We also consider the best choice for lp regularization with all p in (0, 1), where we propose a scheme that adaptively selects the norm value for each image patch. In addition, we provide a method for estimating the best value of the regularization parameter lambda adaptively, and we discuss an alternate iteration method for selecting p and lambda . We perform experiments, which demonstrates that the proposed regularization nonconvex optimization method can outperform the convex optimization method and generate higher quality images.",4
Closed-Loop Modulation of the Pathological Disorders of the Basal Ganglia Network.,"A generalized predictive closed-loop control strategy to improve the basal ganglia activity patterns in Parkinson's disease (PD) is explored in this paper. Based on system identification, an input-output model is established to reveal the relationship between external stimulation and neuronal responses. The model contributes to the implementation of the generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm that generates the optimal stimulation waveform to modulate the activities of neuronal nuclei. By analyzing the roles of two critical control parameters within the GPC law, optimal closed-loop control that has the capability of restoring the normal relay reliability of the thalamus with the least stimulation energy expenditure can be achieved. In comparison with open-loop deep brain stimulation and traditional static control schemes, the generalized predictive closed-loop control strategy can optimize the stimulation waveform without requiring any particular knowledge of the physiological properties of the system. This type of closed-loop control strategy generates an adaptive stimulation waveform with low energy expenditure with the potential to improve the treatments for PD.",4
Landslide Displacement Prediction With Uncertainty Based on Neural Networks With Random Hidden Weights.,"In this paper, we propose a new approach to establish a landslide displacement forecasting model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with random hidden weights. To quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions, a framework for probabilistic forecasting of landslide displacement is developed. The aim of this paper is to construct prediction intervals (PIs) instead of deterministic forecasting. A lower-upper bound estimation (LUBE) method is adopted to construct ANN-based PIs, while a new single hidden layer feedforward ANN with random hidden weights for LUBE is proposed. Unlike the original implementation of LUBE, the input weights and hidden biases of the ANN are randomly chosen, and only the output weights need to be adjusted. Combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA), a hybrid evolutionary algorithm, PSOGSA, is utilized to optimize the output weights. Furthermore, a new ANN objective function, which combines a modified combinational coverage width-based criterion with one-norm regularization, is proposed. Two benchmark data sets and two real-world landslide data sets are presented to illustrate the capability and merit of our method. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can construct high-quality PIs.",4
Neural Network-Based DOBC for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Unmatched Disturbances.,"In this brief, the problem of composite anti-disturbance tracking control for a class of strict-feedback systems with unmatched unknown nonlinear functions and external disturbances is investigated. A disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) in combination with a neural network scheme and back-stepping method is developed to achieve a composite anti-disturbance controller design that provides guaranteed performance. In the proposed method, a conventional disturbance observer and a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) are combined into a new disturbance observer to estimate the unmatched disturbances. As compared with conventional DOBC methods, the primary merit of the proposed method is that the unknown nonlinear functions are approximated using the RBFNN technique, and not regarded as part of the disturbances or estimated by a conventional disturbance observer. Hence, the proposed method can obtain higher control accuracy than the conventional DOBC methods. This advantage is validated by simulation studies.",4
Extended Dissipative State Estimation for Markov Jump Neural Networks With Unreliable Links.,"This paper is concerned with the problem of extended dissipativity-based state estimation for discrete-time Markov jump neural networks (NNs), where the variation of the piecewise time-varying transition probabilities of Markov chain is subject to a set of switching signals satisfying an average dwell-time property. The communication links between the NNs and the estimator are assumed to be imperfect, where the phenomena of signal quantization and data packet dropouts occur simultaneously. The aim of this paper is to contribute with a Markov switching estimator design method, which ensures that the resulting error system is extended stochastically dissipative, in the simultaneous presences of packet dropouts and signal quantization stemmed from unreliable communication links. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of such a problem are established. Based on the derived conditions, an explicit expression of the desired Markov switching estimator is presented. Finally, two illustrated examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.",4
Directional Clustering Through Matrix Factorization.,"This paper deals with a clustering problem where feature vectors are clustered depending on the angle between feature vectors, that is, feature vectors are grouped together if they point roughly in the same direction. This directional distance measure arises in several applications, including document classification and human brain imaging. Using ideas from the field of constrained low-rank matrix factorization and sparse approximation, a novel approach is presented that differs from classical clustering methods, such as seminonnegative matrix factorization, K -EVD, or k -means clustering, yet combines some aspects of all these. As in nonnegative matrix factorization and K -EVD, the matrix decomposition is iteratively refined to optimize a data fidelity term; however, no positivity constraint is enforced directly nor do we need to explicitly compute eigenvectors. As in k -means and K -EVD, each optimization step is followed by a hard cluster assignment. This leads to an efficient algorithm that is shown here to outperform common competitors in terms of clustering performance and/or computation speed. In addition to a detailed theoretical analysis of some of the algorithm's main properties, the approach is empirically evaluated on a range of toy problems, several standard text clustering data sets, and a high-dimensional problem in brain imaging, where functional magnetic resonance imaging data are used to partition the human cerebral cortex into distinct functional regions.",4
Learning to Predict Sequences of Human Visual Fixations.,"Most state-of-the-art visual attention models estimate the probability distribution of fixating the eyes in a location of the image, the so-called saliency maps. Yet, these models do not predict the temporal sequence of eye fixations, which may be valuable for better predicting the human eye fixations, as well as for understanding the role of the different cues during visual exploration. In this paper, we present a method for predicting the sequence of human eye fixations, which is learned from the recorded human eye-tracking data. We use least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) to learn a visual exploration policy that mimics the recorded eye-fixation examples. The model uses a different set of parameters for the different stages of visual exploration that capture the importance of the cues during the scanpath. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using LSPI for combining multiple cues at different stages of the scanpath. The learned parameters suggest that the low-level and high-level cues (semantics) are similarly important at the first eye fixation of the scanpath, and the contribution of high-level cues keeps increasing during the visual exploration. Results show that our approach obtains the state-of-the-art performances on two challenging data sets: 1) OSIE data set and 2) MIT data set.",4
Exponential Stability of Complex-Valued Memristive Recurrent Neural Networks.,"In this brief, we establish a novel complex-valued memristive recurrent neural network (CVMRNN) to study its stability. As a generalization of real-valued memristive neural networks, CVMRNN can be separated into real and imaginary parts. By means of M -matrix and Lyapunov function, the existence, uniqueness, and exponential stability of the equilibrium point for CVMRNNs are investigated, and sufficient conditions are presented. Finally, the effectiveness of obtained results is illustrated by two numerical examples.",4
Out-of-Sample Extensions for Non-Parametric Kernel Methods.,"Choosing suitable kernels plays an important role in the performance of kernel methods. Recently, a number of studies were devoted to developing nonparametric kernels. Without assuming any parametric form of the target kernel, nonparametric kernel learning offers a flexible scheme to utilize the information of the data, which may potentially characterize the data similarity better. The kernel methods using nonparametric kernels are referred to as nonparametric kernel methods. However, many nonparametric kernel methods are restricted to transductive learning, where the prediction function is defined only over the data points given beforehand. They have no straightforward extension for the out-of-sample data points, and thus cannot be applied to inductive learning. In this paper, we show how to make the nonparametric kernel methods applicable to inductive learning. The key problem of out-of-sample extension is how to extend the nonparametric kernel matrix to the corresponding kernel function. A regression approach in the hyper reproducing kernel Hilbert space is proposed to solve this problem. Empirical results indicate that the out-of-sample performance is comparable to the in-sample performance in most cases. Experiments on face recognition demonstrate the superiority of our nonparametric kernel method over the state-of-the-art parametric kernel methods.",4
A Graph-Embedding Approach to Hierarchical Visual Word Mergence.,"Appropriately merging visual words are an effective dimension reduction method for the bag-of-visual-words model in image classification. The approach of hierarchically merging visual words has been extensively employed, because it gives a fully determined merging hierarchy. Existing supervised hierarchical merging methods take different approaches and realize the merging process with various formulations. In this paper, we propose a unified hierarchical merging approach built upon the graph-embedding framework. Our approach is able to merge visual words for any scenario, where a preferred structure and an undesired structure are defined, and, therefore, can effectively attend to all kinds of requirements for the word-merging process. In terms of computational efficiency, we show that our algorithm can seamlessly integrate a fast search strategy developed in our previous work and, thus, well maintain the state-of-the-art merging speed. To the best of our survey, the proposed approach is the first one that addresses the hierarchical visual word mergence in such a flexible and unified manner. As demonstrated, it can maintain excellent image classification performance even after a significant dimension reduction, and outperform all the existing comparable visual word-merging methods. In a broad sense, our work provides an open platform for applying, evaluating, and developing new criteria for hierarchical word-merging tasks.",4
Identification and Control for Singularly Perturbed Systems Using Multitime-Scale Neural Networks.,"Many well-established singular perturbation theories for singularly perturbed systems require the full knowledge of system model parameters. In order to obtain an accurate and faithful model, a new identification scheme for singularly perturbed nonlinear system using multitime-scale recurrent high-order neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this paper. Inspired by the optimal bounded ellipsoid algorithm, which is originally designed for discrete-time systems, a novel weight updating law is developed for continuous-time NNs identification process. Compared with other widely used gradient-descent updating algorithms, this new method can achieve faster convergence, due to its adaptively adjusted learning rate. Based on the identification results, a control scheme using singular perturbation theories is developed. By using singular perturbation methods, the system order is reduced, and the controller structure is simplified. The closed-loop stability is analyzed and the convergence of system states is guaranteed. The effectiveness of the identification and the control scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.",4
DISC: Deep Image Saliency Computing via Progressive Representation Learning.,"Salient object detection increasingly receives attention as an important component or step in several pattern recognition and image processing tasks. Although a variety of powerful saliency models have been intensively proposed, they usually involve heavy feature (or model) engineering based on priors (or assumptions) about the properties of objects and backgrounds. Inspired by the effectiveness of recently developed feature learning, we provide a novel deep image saliency computing (DISC) framework for fine-grained image saliency computing. In particular, we model the image saliency from both the coarse-and fine-level observations, and utilize the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the saliency representation in a progressive manner. In particular, our saliency model is built upon two stacked CNNs. The first CNN generates a coarse-level saliency map by taking the overall image as the input, roughly identifying saliency regions in the global context. Furthermore, we integrate superpixel-based local context information in the first CNN to refine the coarse-level saliency map. Guided by the coarse saliency map, the second CNN focuses on the local context to produce fine-grained and accurate saliency map while preserving object details. For a testing image, the two CNNs collaboratively conduct the saliency computing in one shot. Our DISC framework is capable of uniformly highlighting the objects of interest from complex background while preserving well object details. Extensive experiments on several standard benchmarks suggest that DISC outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and it also generalizes well across data sets without additional training. The executable version of DISC is available online: http://vision.sysu.edu.cn/projects/DISC.",4
Impulsive Effects and Stability Analysis on Memristive Neural Networks With Variable Delays.,"In this brief, hybrid impulsive and adaptive feedback controllers are simultaneously exerted on a general delayed memristive neural network (MNN) model to formulate a novel impulsive controlled MNN (IMNN) model with variable delays. By means of Lyapunov-Razumikhin technique and other analytical ways, several new stability criteria of the proposed IMNN model are obtained. In addition, by choosing appropriate impulses and external inputs, the convergence speed of IMNN can be increased, which implies that its dynamic behaviors will be optimized. Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is illustrated by one numerical example.",4
Artificial Epigenetic Networks: Automatic Decomposition of Dynamical Control Tasks Using Topological Self-Modification.,"This paper describes the artificial epigenetic network, a recurrent connectionist architecture that is able to dynamically modify its topology in order to automatically decompose and solve dynamical problems. The approach is motivated by the behavior of gene regulatory networks, particularly the epigenetic process of chromatin remodeling that leads to topological change and which underlies the differentiation of cells within complex biological organisms. We expected this approach to be useful in situations where there is a need to switch between different dynamical behaviors, and do so in a sensitive and robust manner in the absence of a priori information about problem structure. This hypothesis was tested using a series of dynamical control tasks, each requiring solutions that could express different dynamical behaviors at different stages within the task. In each case, the addition of topological self-modification was shown to improve the performance and robustness of controllers. We believe this is due to the ability of topological changes to stabilize attractors, promoting stability within a dynamical regime while allowing rapid switching between different regimes. Post hoc analysis of the controllers also demonstrated how the partitioning of the networks could provide new insights into problem structure.",4
Sampled-Data Synchronization Analysis of Markovian Neural Networks With Generally Incomplete Transition Rates.,"This paper investigates the problem of sampled-data synchronization for Markovian neural networks with generally incomplete transition rates. Different from traditional Markovian neural networks, each transition rate can be completely unknown or only its estimate value is known in this paper. Compared with most of existing Markovian neural networks, our model is more practical because the transition rates in Markovian processes are difficult to precisely acquire due to the limitations of equipment and the influence of uncertain factors. In addition, the time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is proposed to synchronize drive system and response system. By applying an extended Jensen's integral inequality and Wirtinger's inequality, new delay-dependent synchronization criteria are obtained, which fully utilize the upper bound of variable sampling interval and the sawtooth structure information of varying input delay. Moreover, the desired sampled-data controllers are obtained. Finally, two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Synchronization Control of a Class of Complex Dynamical Networks With General Input Distribution Matrices and Actuator Faults.,"This paper is concerned with the problem of adaptive fault-tolerant synchronization control of a class of complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with actuator faults and unknown coupling weights. The considered input distribution matrix is assumed to be an arbitrary matrix, instead of a unit one. Within this framework, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller is designed to achieve synchronization for the CDN. Moreover, a convex combination technique and an important graph theory result are developed, such that the rigorous convergence analysis of synchronization errors can be conducted. In particular, it is shown that the proposed fault-tolerant synchronization control approach is valid for the CDN with both time-invariant and time-varying coupling weights. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",4
A Proposal for Local $k$ Values for $k$ -Nearest Neighbor Rule.,"The k -nearest neighbor ( k -NN) classifier is one of the most widely used methods of classification due to several interesting features, including good generalization and easy implementation. Although simple, it is usually able to match and even outperform more sophisticated and complex methods. One of the problems with this approach is fixing the appropriate value of k . Although a good value might be obtained using cross validation, it is unlikely that the same value could be optimal for the whole space spanned by the training set. It is evident that different regions of the feature space would require different values of k due to the different distributions of prototypes. The situation of a query instance in the center of a class is very different from the situation of a query instance near the boundary between two classes. In this brief, we present a simple yet powerful approach to setting a local value of k . We associate a potentially different k to every prototype and obtain the best value of k by optimizing a criterion consisting of the local and global effects of the different k values in the neighborhood of the prototype. The proposed method has a fast training stage and the same complexity as the standard k -NN approach at the testing stage. The experiments show that this simple approach can significantly outperform the standard k -NN rule for both standard and class-imbalanced problems in a large set of different problems.",4
Hierarchical Image Segmentation Using Correlation Clustering.,"In this paper, we apply efficient implementations of integer linear programming to the problem of image segmentation. The image is first grouped into superpixels and then local information is extracted for each pair of spatially adjacent superpixels. Given local scores on a map of several hundred superpixels, we use correlation clustering to find the global segmentation that is most consistent with the local evidence. We show that, although correlation clustering is known to be NP-hard, finding the exact global solution is still feasible by breaking the segmentation problem down into subproblems. Each such sub-problem can be viewed as an automatically detected image part. We can further accelerate the process by using the cutting-plane method, which provides a hierarchical structure of the segmentations. The efficiency and improved performance of the proposed method is compared to several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrated on several standard segmentation data sets.",4
Adaptive Modulation for DFIG and STATCOM With High-Voltage Direct Current Transmission.,"This paper develops an adaptive modulation approach for power system control based on the approximate/adaptive dynamic programming method, namely, the goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP). In particular, we focus on the fault recovery problem of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm and a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) with high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission. In this design, the online GrHDP-based controller provides three adaptive supplementary control signals to the DFIG controller, STATCOM controller, and HVDC rectifier controller, respectively. The mechanism is to observe the system states and their derivatives and then provides supplementary control to the plant according to the utility function. With the GrHDP design, the controller can adaptively develop an internal goal representation signal according to the observed power system states, therefore, to achieve more effective learning and modulating. Our control approach is validated on a wind power integrated benchmark system with two areas connected by HVDC transmission lines. Compared with the classical direct HDP and proportional integral control, our GrHDP approach demonstrates the improved transient stability under system faults. Moreover, experiments under different system operating conditions with signal transmission delays are also carried out to further verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.",4
Event-Triggered Generalized Dissipativity Filtering for Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays.,"This paper is concerned with event-triggered generalized dissipativity filtering for a neural network (NN) with a time-varying delay. The signal transmission from the NN to its filter is completed through a communication channel. It is assumed that the network measurement of the NN is sampled periodically. An event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to design a suitable filter such that precious communication resources can be saved significantly while certain filtering performance can be ensured. On the one hand, the event-triggered communication scheme is devised to select only those sampled signals violating a certain threshold to be transmitted, which directly leads to saving of precious communication resources. On the other hand, the filtering error system is modeled as a time-delay system closely dependent on the parameters of the event-triggered scheme. Based on this model, a suitable filter is designed such that certain filtering performance can be ensured, provided that a set of linear matrix inequalities are satisfied. Furthermore, since a generalized dissipativity performance index is introduced, several kinds of event-triggered filtering issues, such as Hinfinity filtering, passive filtering, mixed Hinfinity and passive filtering, (Q,S,R) -dissipative filtering, and L2 - Linfinity filtering, are solved in a unified framework. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Monitoring Nonlinear and Non-Gaussian Processes Using Gaussian Mixture Model-Based Weighted Kernel Independent Component Analysis.,"A kernel independent component analysis (KICA) is widely regarded as an effective approach for nonlinear and non-Gaussian process monitoring. However, the KICA-based monitoring methods treat every KIC equally and cannot highlight the useful KICs associated with fault information. Consequently, fault information may not be explored effectively, which may result in degraded fault detection performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a new nonlinear and non-Gaussian process monitoring method using Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based weighted KICA (WKICA). In particular, in WKICA, GMM is first adopted to estimate the probabilities of the KICs extracted by KICA. The significant KICs embodying the dominant process variation are then discriminated based on the estimated probabilities and assigned with larger weights to capture the significant information during online fault detection. A nonlinear contribution plots method is also developed based on the idea of a sensitivity analysis to help identifying the fault variables after a fault is detected. Simulation studies conducted on a simple four-variable nonlinear system and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional KICA-based method.",4
